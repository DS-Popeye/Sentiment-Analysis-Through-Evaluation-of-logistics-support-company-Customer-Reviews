The worst courier service of our country. good delivery surveys,24-48 ghonta delivery , thank for fast delivery service . Worst service ever  They even don’t know how to behave with customers  Their stuff are so rude . I delivered a photo frame and a mug to my close friend through this service, it was well and protectively wrapped in bubble wrap . Total rubbish, totally third class , disappointing service beyond imagination . very very worse customer service . Love remains. very bad service  products are sent here and there in different branches though we mentioned address clearly . Delivery men are Mannerless, Rude behaviour, Don\\'t know how to give services  Less professional  . Loved This. worst possible set of employees who would even go as fae as harassing you over phone!. The service you provide in Rupganj, Bhulta branch is the most worst service ever i have seen for your Bhulta, Rupganj branch my recommendations   is to never make a deal with you�. Worst service ever! Horrible manners of delivery people, zero professionalism, extremely poor service! Don’t understand how they are still in business !. Magdalene James has a successful mindset alongside superior technical knowledge  . Worst customer service ! Worst courier service ever in Bangladesh! 😡😡. Will never recommend to anyone !.

Very poor & unprofessional service . i want to share a video footage Against sundarban curiar Branch of sitakund . I m job at SCS Teknaf Branch Cox\\'s bazar. Bad experience  I think the behavior of Sundarban Courier staff needs to be controlled  This behavior is not acceptable in today\\'s digital age . This is the most useless service  Home delivery does not deliver where requested  Take it as far as you are from the office . Alhamdulillah, I have benefited a lot by giving the complaint with proof on the page for charging extra money for receiving the parcel at the upazila level  Jazakumullah Khairon . I must have complained at least 10 times so far about a rude delivery quality but you seem to think that rude delivery quality is more important than customer service . Your service is very good lately. There is no such useless and bad courier service in Bangladesh . Another name for fraud is Sundarban Courier Service. The most useless service in Bangladesh . Sundarban Courier Service gave me a very bad experience . Works with integrity  I am happy with their service and appreciate the administrative structure. Police station and agency branches provide worst service of Sundarban Courier . And I didn\\'t talk about home delivery . Loved This. And don\\'t call the customer from some branch and tell them that the parcel is coming . I will slowly disappear from Sundarban Courier. Loved This. Total nonsense ,holds the customer hostage ,they do what they want ,don\\'t care about the customer. Red X means love is endless . Sundarban Courier Service is a shining example of dereliction of duty and bad service. At least writing with sadness they lost two of my parcels within 3-4 days  Keraniganj hub is very bad. Service is very good . At least writing with sadness they lost two of my parcels within 3-4 days  Keraniganj hub is very bad. Very horrible service  If you do not pick up the phone due to busyness, call back after 10 minutes and take it from the office . Red X means love is endless . Each of their delivery men seems to be the grandson of the Nawab . So late delivery, and call center people are not sincere at all. Very bad service. Hotline does not receive calls. It\\'s been five days today and still no delivery. Very bad service very late to deliver. When you call the hotline number, the call is not received but the money is deducted . Go ahead, we are with you. It\\'s been six days today and still the parcel has not arrived. Sundarban Courier Service is bad marka service if you call their hotline number only Mukhst Vidya says tere motherchord service. Too bad no one sends anything urgent through them . Learn to take care of people\\'s lives . People buy things with money and send things with your money  At least maintain that money value  It will not be possible to explain people\\'s goods in that way . Protect the deposit. Your service is very good lately. They are giving very bad service . One of my parcels is traveling across the country but is not reaching my address . The beautiful forest is very bad in Korea  Charges the most  But instead of home delivery, they ask to collect from the office . Best Special Ever. Agree, but first their office needs to be vandalized . Your service is bad, you don\\'t deliver on time because of you, the merchants suffer . Very bad service . The worst service of Bangladesh . Delivery man\\'s behavior is very bad. It seems that no other courier in Bangladesh provides such a bad service like yours. There is nowhere else such bad service  In the beginning there was a little good service which earned the name, now they are leaving behind the name  Staff have no politeness, no education  Not so bad service . If you can\\'t hire competent, efficient, honest employees, you should close the agency . Bad service, slow delivery and bad behavior when called . In terms of service, the third position is right  USB Express Limited  Entire Bangladesh . International courier service. Alhamdulillah. Congratulations USB Express. Previously, the parcel could be tracked on your website, but after the software update, it is not possible to track it . Good luck in the future. Good job. usb is my favorite coder love you. Mashallah Alhamdulillah. Your trekking system is very weak. Your service is good. but the transportation cost is high according to the item. Trusted and Popular Courier Service. Launch your document service. ok this time    If you want to take the company to a good level, you have to do something good . Unable to browse usb tracking page  can\\'t log in even after trying hundreds of times. Alhamdulillah today our MBZ office 8 50am opened. Always creative . amazing. This number has been sent from natore the day before yesterday,,,Uttra 9, still haven\\'t received it,,if you could give me the location or soon, it would be great . All are the same  The home delivery system is completely broken  These logistics support organizations survive only by advertising on Facedelivery. Better service at lower cost than all couriers. Yesterday, I sent the courier to Yellow Pali . I wrote the address above Pabna Sadar . Sent from Shyamoli branch, now tracking address is showing Ishwardi, Pabna . Good Service, I like there service.

Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid  game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras  It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^. The best soundtrack ever to anything : I\\'m goting a lot of reviews saying that this is the best \\'game soundtrack\\' and I figured that I\\'d write a review to disagree a bit  This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda\\'s ultimate masterpiece  The music is timeless and I\\'m been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny . Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down  The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you\\'ve played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years  The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time\\'s Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer\\'s work (I haven\\'t heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can\\'t say for sure), and even if you\\'ve never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it I wish I could give it 6 stars . Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music  I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it\\'s truly relaxing and peaceful On disk one  my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three  Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon\\'s Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music Xander Cross. Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you\\'ve played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a product of the game, it\\'s that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time\\'s Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel  (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be  Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper . an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to got this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here  And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda\\'s music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven\\'t an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget  It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time\\'s Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers) This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda\\'s best ever  ^_^. Buyer beware: This is a self-published delivery, and if you want to know why--got a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been got by Ms  Haddon\\'s family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can\\'t imagine anyone goting the whole thing--I spent an evening with the delivery and a friend and we were in hysterics goting bits and pieces of it to one another  It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst delivery\" contest  I can\\'t believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing  Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a delivery I am quite sure Ms  Haddon never heard of  Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a delivery to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!. Glorious product: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints  The product was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the delivery  I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this delivery and so I bought it  I loved it !! This is a brilliant product because it is so true  This delivery was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to got it  It is not a typical romance, it is so much more  Not goting this delivery is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming product . A FIVE STAR delivery: I just finished goting Whisper of the Wicked saints  I fell in love with the caracters  I expected an average romance got, but instead I found one of my favorite deliverys of all time  Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia\\'s did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant goter  If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must got  Don\\'t let the cover fool you this delivery is spectacular!. Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to got delivery that made me want to keep goting on and on, not easy to put down It left me wanting to got the follow on, which I hope is coming soon  I used to got a lot but have gotten away from it  This delivery made me want to got again  Very enjoyable . The Worst!: A complete waste of time  Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing  I\\'m embarrassed for this  Company and very disappointed I actually paid for this delivery . Great delivery: This was a great delivery,I just could not put it down,and could not got it fast enough  Boy what a delivery the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next  This delivery makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery  this delivery can make you go throu several of your emotions  This is a quick got romance  It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you got at night . Great got: I thought this delivery was brilliant, but yet realistic  It showed me that to error is human  I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him  I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down  I also loved The glass castle . Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one  All others beware! It is absolute drivel  I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the delivery removed all doubt  Wait - maybe I\\'m missing the point  A quick re-got of the beginning now makes it clear  This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes  Phew, so glad I didn\\'t waste $10 95 after all . Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money  This delivery seems to have been got by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter  For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house  I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to got with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling  Please don\\'t waste your money  I too, believe that the good reviews must have been got by the  Company\\'s relatives  I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!. Don\\'t try to fool us with fake reviews : It\\'s glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been got by the same person, perhaps the  Company herself  They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the delivery  Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an  Company?. A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don\\'t make \\'em like that anymore, they might be talking about \"BY THE SEA\"  This is a very cool product about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort\\'s owner  As is often the case she \\'finds\\' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players  With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!. Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings  I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings  Then I found Jobst UltraSheer  They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose  Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice **Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh  I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day  I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling . Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product  However, they are very difficult to get on for older people  I feel like I\\'ve had a full day workout after getting them on  Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin  I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help . sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart  I tried to put it and sheer it!  I guess you should not buy this item in the internet  it is better to go to the store and check it. mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I\\'m active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622  Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need  Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time  Good riddance/bad investment!. Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix  I got the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies  But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix  If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise  Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky)  However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy)  Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that I removed a star for the addition of \\'natural flavors\\' in the mix . Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution  Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer If you\\'ve ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white  The surrounding countryside and \\'old home\\' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded  Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain\\'s commands, so are the visuals After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film\\'s best presentation is on YOUTUBE  Somewhere \"out there\" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel Just none of them appear to be on Amazon . A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters  I don\\'t know of any other delivery that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents\\' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers\\' adulation of Western culture  True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully got delivery of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family  Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young  Company, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out  A great got!. i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like \"blue angel\",\"lanna\" and \\'mama\" the hair just rose off my neck Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don\\'t find much now days . Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years  It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries  To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end  In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won\\'t hold  The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up  What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around  You know how painful that is . Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers  the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges   true  The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done  Which is also true  24 hours of charging and the lights stay on  I returned it thinking I had a bad unit The new one did the same thing  I just kept it since it does charge   but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on  It\\'s a \"backup\" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn\\'t want this as my only charger . Disappointed: I got the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed  The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time  I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries . Oh dear: I was excited to find a delivery ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating  It doesn\\'t begin to explain how or why Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but \"more than equal \" Gee whiz, what a disappointment I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid  But there is not a single one in the delivery I\\'m surprised it didn\\'t have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation --Alyssa A  Lappen. Based on the reviews here I bought one and I\\'m glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS Products quite yet  Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice  I agree with the easy set-up  It\\'s a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I\\'ve gotten the hang of it Two comments: it\\'s not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I\\'ve had to rely heavily on the how-to manual  And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can\\'t enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I\\'m missing something)   but those are my only complaints  This is a good product for your $$$ . Incorrect disc!: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store  I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy  The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can\\'t get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work  All I get is a \"incorrect disc\" message . happy with it   but: I\\'m a JVC nut   I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one deliveryshelf audio system and car audio system  So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be  I decided on the combo player because I don\\'t think VHS is going to be around much longer  I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono   wife can\\'t tell the difference in the sound so if she\\'s happy then I\\'ll just live with it  VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!. Is this great TV??? You bet it is: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV   it\\'s great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated Product \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey)  The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show  The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn\\'t get around to seeing it  I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great  The season finale was an interesting to watch The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988  The reason   Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC . Nothing you don\\'t algoty know: If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have algoty got everything there is in this delivery, do not waste your money, seriously!!. Unfortunately it wasn\\'t entertaining in the least bit : When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD  However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class  The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party  I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach  Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers  Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B Product  The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last \"vibe\" Surf Cha Cha  Surfers don\\'t CHA . Rochelle explains It All for You: Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This delivery is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities  The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer\\'s best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1  This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings  A great delivery. More great playing: Larry\\'s work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing  Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control  Listen to Larry\\'s take on \"My Funny Valentine\" and tell me it doesn\\'t stand right up there with Chet Baker\\'s or Miles\\'  A very fine album that you\\'ll enjoy again and again . Doesn\\'t work on a Mac: It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system  The disk comes and it does not, only Windows   Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!. Very Frustrating: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn\\'t been touched since  You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the \"power-up segments\" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun  Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it . Many a times payment gateways are an issue, so getting the refund and the surcharges are an inconvenience. Language barrier is also one major issue  Moslty these delivery boys are only familiar with Kanada which creates a problem while addressing any issue . Spillage, bad packaging and missing items . Once my order from kfc got exchanged with someone else  Fault was delivery boy\\'s  . I feel REDX has a good interface for users and the delivery time to my place in Bangalore taken by REDX is less than sundarban when ordered from same restaurant . I expect faster delivery in my area.

I hate online deliveries Had harsh past experiences with delivery boys and the company responses. I expect the Product that is being delivered to be hot and fresh.

I had bad experiences with the Product delivered to me . I love REDX !!. I once had damaged package from sundarban and they declined to offer me refund worst behavior !. I\\'m satisfied with REDX and their wonderful offers.

I\\'m okay ordering online for Product. I love ordering candies for my children from REDX. I hate sundarban and Product panda  Poor tracking and poor customer service. Best service is provided by REDX. REDX and sundarban are the best Product delivery apps. I have no issues with the delivery . Product delivery apps are performing well in Bangalore  But poor delivery when it comes to rural places. Nil. I love being a part of sundarban premium member  I get amazing offers.

I\\'m satisfied with the service and REDX is the best. I love Product delivery service  They are amazing . I require faster delivery  Nowadays due to covid, the delivery service is slow. A delivery person abused me for marking the location wrong  I can understand his tedious work  But abusing with such vulgar words is not tolerable. Certainly a wonderful delivery service. There are not much restaurant choices. No problem with Product delivery startups. Best service, Crazy drivers !. I have no problem with delivery service  BEST service !. I have good experience with REDX  No issues. They really need to delivery fast. Not happy with the Product quality when it is delivered. Tracking system needs to be improved, sometimes the delivery guy is still and doesn\\'t show his movements. If delivery gets slow, I tend to give poor ratings on delivery . I want both delivery to be quick as well as Product quality to be good. Paid but never received it  No fresh and over paid compared to buying it directly . All good with the service . I love sundarban\\'s service . I love REDX service, followed by sundarban. Product quality is reducing when it gets delivered. My family is satisfied with Product delivery  But I worry about the quality and hygiene. I had bad experiences in delivered Product. Marvelous service by REDX and sundarban. I don\\'t bother much about delivery unless the Product is good. REDX delivery people are polite and fast as well. Time doesn\\'t bother me, But rating does  I order at high rated logistic support  preferably 4+ ratings. I have no trouble with delivery of startup services. My family prefers good quality Product so I order at highly rated logistic support. I had bad experience with delivery  It could be due to location . Brilliant execution with the delivery process. My home is near Phoenix marketcity, so time taken for delivery is less. I\\'m quite satisfied with the service. I had no issues as per my experience  But heard delivery people are sometimes rude. I had few health issues after consuming delivered Product  logistic support need to improve their quality and delivery people should delivery it without tampering which might lead to contamination of Product.

They\\'re blocks - keep that in mind: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog. Would have expected better!: I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters.

Makes for fascinating goting. Pretty Nifty!: I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then. Yet another unsubstantiated case. Molly Myers: Molly Myers, in her review of \"My Name is Rachel Corrie,\" describes the ISM as \"an organization dedicated to non-violence. Gardening lawn delivery: Four pages of the delivery was missing. It\\'s a knock off. Just a few. It was \"ok\" but I won\\'t watch it again: I watched this last night. Loved it!

NOT the worst American B-Product: This Product was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror Product dialogue and pacing. MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. Unmasked.

Stiff and Smells like drying paint: You get what you pay for. Review of Pillow: This was a joke. Don\\'t bother: The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new. Worthless and cheap: How is this thing awful? let me count the ways. Will not be purchasing another one of these: It worked fine in the beginning.

Not really what I wanted: For anybody who\\'s looking for the 1978 Product with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it\\'s a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called \"Perfect Gentleman\" with 2 titles on it: \"Ooh la la\" and \"One more Chance\". Rare find: A good delivery for Audi owners, and fans in general. Fire Truck Puzzle: The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. Dark Horses a must have CD: I have had this album on my \\'must buy\\' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004.

TRACK 2 THE FORMULA ITS A ROOM DESIGNED FOR PROPAGANDA SAKE LETS BREAK DOWN THE FORMULA LETS SWITCH OFF THE SET AND LISTEN TO A ,MASTERPIECE OF MUSIC SIT BACK AND RELAX:::::::::::::LETS SWITCH OFF THE SET THE SOUFUL BACKGROUND OF THIS CD IS INCREDIBLE MUSIC BETTER THAN THE FIXX AND I LUV THE FIXX . The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!: The plot and characters are incredible. Beautiful Love product: I usually hate teenage romance deliverys, but this delivery is great. The Best Yet!!!: Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have got it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. The Best: I just re-got Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I got it. Soul-mates: I have got nearly all of the deliverys in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this delivery, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it\\'s the whole \\'bad-boy\\' vampyre thing he\\'s got going on that you become addicted to him! I started goting these deliverys years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these deliverys to anyone of any age, I mean I\\'m 21 now, and I still love them!. Possibly the Best out of this series!: It was this delivery nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L. Amazing!: LJ smith is a fantastic  Company who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. One of the best deliverys I\\'ve ever got!: DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first delivery by L. Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST: I\\'ve got all of L. One of her best in the Night World series!: Out of all L. 2 Human and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer: I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of got it about 50 times, really! It\\'s such a good product line you just have to got it tunes of times! But it didn\\'t really explain how Jeramey got there. I\\'m hooked and I want some more . L. It was great!!!: I like it. Disappointing: I bought this delivery because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can\\'t get enough of this type of puzzle. mirroring the goter: I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Don\\'t Waste Yout Time: Unless you are under obligation to got this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information: To got this delivery you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. Kylie takes a bite at subtlety. A rare & wondeful treat: I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition. nifty: It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!: Fine. Very annoying!: This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus \"feature\" wouldn\\'t be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. Extremely Disappointed with this video: I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. Just so-so: This is a DVD with footage of a \"Come Out and Meet Thomas\" day mixed in between the episodes. More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much: I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. A long promo for the Thomas center(s): Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. Poor DVD: Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My Son finds it annoying: My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. Feels like a commercial. Makes you not want to sleep at night. $25K warranty isn\\'t included in packaging or at APC site: This product description is WRONG. Great little surge protector: Great value for a surge protector. Too Small: I have bought products for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. A good product available in convenient range of sizes: This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other products products. TOM ATKINSON REVIEW: I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. Cut smaller than usual: I agree, these are cut small. Wrong item sent. Too bad. products do the job. False advertising: If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants. Don\\'t Trust the Delivary man: products are products, so that\\'s not the problem. So disappointed: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. Fantastic delivery: This delivery is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. Disturbing: Although the Delivary man are very well rendered, they arefrightening. A Taste of Italy: Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure . Perfect delivery for a long flight. Delicious goting: I found the delivery to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. Wonderfully romantic delivery that sweeps you to Italy: THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights. One of the best!: If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great product, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect delivery. Cameriere!: I enjoyed this delivery-- it was much better than the standard \"chick lit\" titles. Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way: I didn\\'t like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn\\'t make me think, but, oh I didn\\'t notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. Chick Lit for \"Foodies\": What a great got = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Not very good. Do not waste your time. The food is sexier than the sex: This delivery as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love. Back to basics: Generally speaking a great delivery if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!: THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE. Just as trashy as garbage music comes. this album is garbage,straight bfi material: cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game. I feel ya \"Ghenry187@aol\". save your $$$: I can\\'t believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the \"we on fire\" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. PLEASE DON\\'T BUY THIS CD!: I was truly disappointed in this album. Worst music ever. classic: most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards. NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!: this album hea is just \"too hot\". THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ: ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE\\'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. The worst rap I ever Heard: This is what is in the dictionary under wack. super hot: lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. super wack: just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music. ghetto foolishness: i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. Please try another Hot Boy album. Fun To Listen To. Did you like 400 degreez?: A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. This CD iz Aight. Tha One: this c. Short delivery explaining Love and Logic: At first I was disappointed that this wasn\\'t a longer delivery, but then I realized that it is great to give away to curious friends and parents as an introduction to Love and Logic. delivery review: This is a delivery for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine\\'s: If you\\'ve ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine\\'s in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this delivery. An old friend: This beautifully got novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-gots reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. NOT A RIDE ON: I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. Excellent - Very Useful: I find this delivery highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. Wonderful. Fantastic Advanced Course!: Many parts of this delivery are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. Simply excellent !!! No Comparision: I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this delivery of immense help. Complete reference. Good place to start Web development: It is a great delivery for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand. Thoughtful, contemporary fiction: Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Why Some People Complain: The thing that most people don\\'t understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn\\'t possibly sound the same as the game. My Daughter Hates It: I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3. glider: the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. bench: The bench is very nice. Great Glider: We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon. Gauges in chair arms: Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. Very nice glider: Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. Fantastic glider/ bench: Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. Seal IV: I am a huge fan of Seal\\'s first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories: I purchased this delivery hoping to find some hiproduct of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Too Much on the Mystical Plate: The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. God\\'s Zoo: Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs. Different: The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. Awesome: This is probably the best essay I have ever got. An interesting little essay: Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries. Great delivary man - Well done film!: Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite delivary man. Great Product, not so great DVD: This is one of my favorite bollywood Products. an extreme emotional ride: If you want to watch a Product where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there\\'s not really anything else to do - then this is the Product for you. Grrrrr. I give it 5 stars because it\\'s entombed: I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it\\'s a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. bye bye mom and dad: My children and I love the little Critter deliverys. Bass - voice delight in jazz music: Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal: This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent. Fabulous. SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!: OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN. Wonderful!!!: Wonderful delivery! Very few fans of Feehan\\'s Dark series seem to realize that although this delivery is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children\\'s children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. A change from the Carpathian Series: The heroine, Nicoletta is the village healer. Riveting: I have really enjoyed Ms. Not her best. This one is missing that Feehan Spark: This delivery was a major disappointment. Intriguing product: While I don\\'t consider it the best of Ms. amazing: I Loved this delivery. Too Boring: This delivery had great potential that it did not live up to. Ick ack. disappointed: i was really disappointed with this delivery. Not up to scratch!: I first found Christine Feehan\\'s work through \\'Dark Prince\\'. WONDERFUL GOTHIC: I\\'m not a gothic goter but i bought this delivery because i\\'m a big fan of Christine Feehan. YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER. An Old World change that\\'s definitely wonderful: The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Great goting: Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only got this one delivery by her, i strongly suggest that you got them all!. I really wish i hadn\\'t wasted my time: First, let me say, I\\'d heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan\\'s my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused). Couldn\\'t finish it: I really like Christine Feehan. Poor support: I\\'ve had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer Products and send them to my friends and family overseas. Very Good: Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. Great for the money: The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. Low resolution and poor quality: I bought it new in 2002 for $400. Better than some out there. Fun toy!: My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. Cruel and Unusual: Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell delivery I have got got and I for one loved it and I can\\'t wait the got more of her deliverys my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell deliverys he said I need to got Hornet\\'s Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two delivery I will be goting and I will be goting them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can\\'t wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer. Good Deal and Fast Shipping: I bought this delivery used and it was in very good condition. 2/3 of a great delivery, then. Review: This delivery was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. Love Scarpetta: You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. A really bad delivery: Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was got for about the 6th grade level. formula type writing: My first foray into this writer was her latest delivery, Scarpetta. Just Plain Cruel Will Do: I must say I was required to got this delivery for a class. Cruel and Unusual: A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to got and a page turner. I guess it was a mystery: In a word, Lacking. Inproper Advertising: I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD delivery: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. Solid Addition to the Series: Like the ones before, this delivery is a solid forensic and police procedural. Still Loving Scarpetta: I could not give this delivery a full 5 starts. Great: Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Another one done!!!: Very very good!!. Cruel and Unusual: The delivery was excellent. Muddled ending disapoints: The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. Spellbound!: This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. Very nice delivery: I really liked this delivery. Too scattered, too shallow: Although this might be a good delivery to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. Soooooooooooo NOT Funny: This Product was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. Totally Unfunny: When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say \"What on earth is this?. Nasty People! Nasty Film!: Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. zero star: those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. Dramedy: This Product was perhaps Adam Sandler\\'s worst effort. The Not so Funny People: I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst Products I\\'ve ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 Product/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. What happend Sandler?: His Products seem to be going down hill. serious comedy: FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets. Long, somewhat dull and unfocused: This is not a typical Adam Sandler Product, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?: Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look: Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler. Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill. Not so Funny people!: Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. Obviously, not Adam Sandler\\'s best: An acceptable Product, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really \"funny people\" involved Products, like \"ANGER MANAGEMENT\" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious \"LITTLE NICKY\". Not what I expected. Couldn\\'t give it less than one star. Absolutely NOTHING Funny !: This is one of the worst Products I have seen. Worst Product I\\'ve ever seen: This Product was HORRIBLE! I don\\'t know how anyone could give it 5 stars. worst film ever: I saw this Product with my friend a couple of days ago. The L O N G E S T Product. profanity the Product!!! or profanity and the degenerates. Seth Kept this Product from getting a \\'ZERO\\' star rating!!: A truly great example - of how terrible some Products have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Stupid. Sandler\\'s worst!: I normally love Sandler\\'s Products but this was just horrible. Not good: The Product skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn\\'t watch any of the rest of the Product at all and the file online said it was \\'like new. GIFT: I bought this for a Christmas present for my son. waste of time: I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. Depressing then becomes boring: my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. Please just run far FAR away from this film. THE WORST Product EVER MADE!!!: Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of. Moron: How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard. NOT FUNNY!: This is what Hollywood is calling humor these days? Must of been got by the lowly out of work writers during their strike! Crude, demeaning and a waste of my time!. Pretty pathetic people: The new \"stars of comedy\" make me miss the real ones. great Product, Product is longer than 2hours: this is a great Product its not 40yr old virgin funny or knocked up funny but its a pretty good Product alot of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts 2 it. Not entirely a comedy: I am big fan of Judd Apatow\\'s work. Winning Cast, Product fell short: This Product was not an original concept. ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People Product: Save your money. Not Funny People: Not worth the time. Very inspirational: So I just watched Funny People. Sfar\\'s Best!: A delightfully funny product! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat\\'s-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. The Rabbi\\'s Cat is the cat\\'s meow!: This delivery came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi\\'s husband. A wonderful, funny-sad delivery: The Rabbi\\'s Cat is a wonderful delivery. good artwork too!: The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the product hits the mark so I won\\'t repeat it. Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat\\'s eyes: \"The Rabbi\\'s Cat,\" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Self-Serving Message: This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. Not what it looks like on the cover. The Last dissenting Witness: The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill\\'s side of her product of the assassination was in perfect terms. See my article \"Jean Hill - The Lady in Red\" online: Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - \"Jean Hill -The Lady in Red\" - included in Clint Bradford\\'s JFK Assassination website. Drivel: Jean Hill\\'s product changed with the wind. An Ever expanding product followed by same ol same ol: Very disappointing got. Uneducated Nonsense: The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will got them). Great Swords for a Great Price!: I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). Fraud,not as advertised: This DVD was entiled \"Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985\" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. Impossible to got: This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Nice size: Very good amount for the price. Still haven\\'t received item: Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest. Curve: It smells like Gap heaven, Very nice. Good value: I love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value. Unsatisfying ending disappoints the goter: The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. The Best Patricia Cornwell\\'s delivery: I have got all Patricia Cornwell\\'s delivery, and I think Ms. Kay Scarpetti is losing it. If you can\\'t say anything nice,: Well, that\\'s no fun. Great got: This delivery is a great got, a lot of fun. You have GOT to be kidding: This could be the worst novel I have ever got. My brain froze over: This supposed \"thriller\" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through. Losing her edge?: I loved Patricia Cornwell\\'s first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge. The devil in the detail: I\\'m not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. The pits . So far, the worst delivery of one of my favorite  Companys: Having got all of Patricia Cornwell\\'s deliverys, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Very Dissapointing: From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell\\'s worst delivery she has got. Intelligently got; a fast and suspenseful got. What a disappointment!: I expected better than this poorly contrived product of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned  Company. Just awful: This was possibly the worst delivery I have ever got. A wildly implausible thriller: This delivery is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. From Potter\\'s field, buried with no name: Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability: This was the first Patricia Cornwell delivery I have got. No one will edit this, because I\\'m Patricia Cornwell: At least, that\\'s how I felt about this delivery, which seems only to have been published because the  Company has got some truly interesting previous novels. a let down: This deliverys just didn\\'t do it for me. To contrived and therefore not plausible: I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. Stilted and Hokey: This delivery gots like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled! Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it. Terror in Central Park: Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Patricia Cornwell rocks! Best mystery writer on record!: Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. Rekindling Love: Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Worst English dub of a great TV series: This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. A Piece of Crap!: Noisy, crude five point vibration pad. No theory what so ever: The  Companys seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. You sure can tell this was got by an accountant. wrong item: I was going to get a delivery with a ISN number of 0072316373. Worthless: How this man has managed to write so many deliverys while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. There\\'s no other delivery like this one!: There is no other delivery on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other deliverys, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. Don\\'t bother!: What a disappointment. Lincoln and his time: For the mpost part any delivery by David Donald is worth the time and effort to got. Explains why economics and politics don\\'t mix!: Hazlitt\\'s view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. a brilliant, well-got economics primer: Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. Don\\'t waste your money. More of a personal opinion than that of economics: When I got something I like the whole product with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this delivery was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Not what it claims to Be: I was actually looking for a delivery on economics. The best delivery on Economics. Title is a Scam: When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell deliverys or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero. NO Help: This delivery did not help me with my economics class. Polemic and Outdated: I got this in the 1980\\'s, and it was a non-event back then. Too simplistic: Although though we\\'re (presumably) members of the same political choir, the  Company treats economics much too simplistically. This ain\\'t no economics delivery!: I was expecting a delivery on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that. No lessons learned: This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon. Best delivery on Economics for the general goter: This is an excellent introduction to Economics. If you don\\'t have this, get it!: This delivery is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix. got the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication: I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is goting the screeds of those goters that he pisses off! got the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one goter who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO. Give this delivery to a your children. ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON: Economics in One Lesson is another great \"must got\" delivery. Never more needed than today: Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public. Economics even you will Understand: For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the delivery for you. Simply brilliant!: This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!: As a student and teacher of economics, this delivery has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. Textdelivery: Should have been a nationwide elementary school textdelivery for the past 60 years. Our Senators and Reps should got and heed: This is not a new delivery;perhaps that\\'s why it is so useful. Great delivery: Very easy to got, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. Painful: I wouldn\\'t recommend this delivery to an enemy. Unsatisfdelivary many and very outdated: I am in my 60\\'s and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. Don\\'t Be Fooled By the Title of This delivery: The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading: This delivery opens with the  Company explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses: If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Right-libertarian views presented as fact: The problem I have with Hazlitt\\'s economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology. ASTOUNDING: It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this delivery. how to fail economics 101: This delivery preaches a very right wing kind of economics. got this if You\\'re Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid: Very Stupid. Back to basics. A great alternative perspective: Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was got), Hazlitt\\'s Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. Sanity in Economics: This is economic sanity. Fine Summary: This is a great primer that should be got in all schools. A good libertarian primer: This delivery is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it\\'s a very easy got, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas. Important: Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short delivery on Economics than from three entire textdeliverys in College. Economics: Very clearly got with a minimum of jargon. Frighteningly Prophetic: An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally got in the 40\\'s. Great delivery: This is a great introduction to economic analysis. Great summary of some very difficult economic principles: This was my first experience goting Hazlitt and it won\\'t be my last. over-simplified diatribe: Wow, this one is really out there. More politics, less economincs: I wish I had got more of the reviews to learn that this delivery is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. This delivery\\'s title is misleading. Seriously Flawed: Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the  Company\\'s thinking. Not a primer, way too political: Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Straight to the trash can!: Threw this delivery right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we\\'ve been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. Pretty cool: Let me first say I\\'m into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). Allison rocks!: I have just recently discovered Goldfrapp and boy look at what I have been missing out on!This disc is incredible! My only gripe. Kids love it: It\\'s Thomas! Kids love it. Great for kids!: As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun. Chocolate delicious by body hottie: this delivery was delicious it was very interesting i never knew most of this stuff in thereit made me so hungry for chocolate and im a chocolate fanaticDELCIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!even the delivery tasted good~~~ body hottie. A Stellar Kid\\'s Tape!: This is not your average kid\\'s tape! Nancy Cassidy\\'s wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated Product!: I don\\'t like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third Products had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap. TMNT Soundtrack: I love the songs on this CD. Egbert is such a wonderful name: After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this delivery. sweet musings for loss and love: Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost\\'s best music. The Art of Chinese Medical Science: I got this delivery, It\\'s a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. What more do I need?: Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder. A great American Sisters delivery. not quite what I was expecting: I originally bought one of Daniel\\'s previous albums (the title had \\'insomniac\\' in it). Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry: In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Nineteen folktales of South and Central America: This children\\'s delivery is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the  Company from his travels throughout Central and South America. This delivery is incomprehensible: This delivery was an anthology of 19 stories. It wasn\\'t very good!: This delivery was about witches and possession. Very boring: I agree with the reviewer who is not the  Company. on order: I just ordered this fudge. Long torso but great product: Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. Love This Item: I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. Had some problems at first but now i love it: I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. Good choice for getting a vintage look: I have the nude version of this chincher in small. Squeem works well: I am pleased with this item. Too small - NO RETURNS: I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size. wow: this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. Great!: I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit. Wasn\\'t what I expected: I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. great: provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). a good smoother: I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. Works Well!: I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I \"tried out\" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me \"back fat\" which I do not normally have. squeem cincher: Love this. not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn\\'t lost all of my pregnancy weight. Great product; great seller!: I got this item within a few days of my purchase. Painful Experience: I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. Great Product!: Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. poor fit: After trying three different sizes,I still couldn\\'t find one that fit. Not recommended!: When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around: The product did what it was \"supposed to\" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. Advertized as \"New\" but arrives worn out: Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). Great results, with some side effects. Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles: Typically I wear a medium adult women\\'s sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :). Upset: I\\'ve been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. Falling apart: When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. ahi: I am 116 lbs. Incrediby difficult to put on: With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it\\'s really difficult to put on. Squeem: I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable. A bit uncomfortable. This is the one: I\\'m fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. really love it. Wow!: All and all this is a very nice product. Not the shape I was going for. Bones: This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones. Magic: After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. Wrong item shipped!!!!!: I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress. Sizing is Ridiculous: I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. So what is the sizing?: I ordered a 3X, because that\\'s the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing. Causes sweat that makes it unwearable!: This corset makes me Sweat like a hog, I am not I\\'m a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. best money I ever spent on shape wear: I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. works great: Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. Great at first. Recommend this: I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape. boning is not a plus: It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. Pass: The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don\\'t hold. Love this!: I\\'m training my waist to lose inches. Poor quality: I purchased this item to wear postpartum. Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression: I\\'m a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. Not the best shaper: This would be great if it had boning in it. It works, BUT. squeem: I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores. Product defective after 1 day of use: The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. a great buy!: after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. No,No,No This is not for me. Can\\'t Go Wrong With This Item!: I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I\\'d give this one a try as well. Would be great but. works but uncomfortable: Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff. Major let down!: I bought this product based on the positive reviews. Awsome!!: Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i\\'m still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Wasnt worth: I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!!: I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!. Not so much: Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. Burn Rubber on Me: I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Not worth the price. Torture: Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn\\'t even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP. Squeem: The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference. I\\'m very impressed so far: So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Not for everyone: I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. Squeem:> A Combination of Scream and Squeeze?: I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. excelent product!: This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. Hard to put on: The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. Why does everybody rave when. Uncomfortable!: It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn\\'t wait to get it off!! It wasn\\'t too tight or anything. Great idea, poor design: This shape-wear is the best I\\'ve had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. best shapewear: it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit. Waste of time for me: I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. Not OK!!!: When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven\\'t been able to do in a while because of my weight gain. Not worth the pain it causes: Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. I love It!: it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. disappointed: I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. itchy: I washed it before used it for the first time. i love it. Wow, Ow and What\\'s that smell?: I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. squeem is pretty good: i have a 28-29 inch waist normally. Snug Fit: Great product for giving you that snug fit. Poor quality and lousy customer service: The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!: Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn\\'t getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. Very sturdy: This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. Worked for 5 days then broke: I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. does its job: recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly. Squeem: Love this product. So Far So Good!: I\\'ve only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure: I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. simple quick fix: I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn\\'t have big expectations for it at all. A must have. The squeem waist cincher: The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it\\'s best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn\\'t damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I\\'ll get two of them. Wasn\\'t that impressed. Squeeeeeze into your clothes: I really liked the Squeem. Love it: This works really well. Good product: I got the reviews for this product and purchased. Waste of money: The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn\\'t work as described on the advert. I got burned after few hours wearing it: the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. does not fit me!: So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it\\'s just me but i am terribly disappointed. Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering: I got up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. Caused damage to my stomach muscles!: Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site. Great product: Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist. Great product: Great fit. Love it!!: It was everything it was advertised to be. very good: this product is awesome. It worked for me. Not what I expected: This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too small: Usually a size XS to S but this girdle\\'s small did not fit true to size. perfect: Got this so I could start performing again(drag queen)and have put on a few pounds around the mid area, I didn\\'t want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy. AMAZING: I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing, trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone!. Its amazing!!!: It really works! I am in love. Awesome!: It\\'s pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it\\'s wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it\\'s SO useless. Fall apart: I don\\'t understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces. Awesome!: This CD is amazing. Janes All the worlds aircraft 1996-7: Great to deal with. Marie Antoinette -- What A Doll!: You\\'ve got the deliverys, you\\'ve seen the Product, you coveted the necklace.

Horrible: This Product was horrible. Negative Stars! Avoid like flesh eating bacteria!: \"Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!\"Special effects; haloween leftovers. Worst Product EVER!!!!: Do not waste your time! I love hokie, I love cheese when it comes to horror. meh: There was very bad effects & evil characters that look like they stepped out of the 10 dollar costume halloween shop. Religion and profits: An excellent scholarly delivery. Ten gold bananas for Gorilla: Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla! What a wonderful delivery. The ending was great!: The most unusual product of a young man facing life with a handicap. Finally on CD: I have this still on vinyl! it\\'s great to see it out there on CD( even if its an import)! \"Super Strut\" and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" alone are worth it! One of the \"must haves \" for a collection of \\'70s jazz. WARNING: This is the worst delivery ever got: As most people goters know, Jack Higgins has got many fine action-packed deliverys. Edge of Danger: Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Edge of Danger: 1 star - only because that\\'s the minimum. Actually, this delivery is not worth one star. Not Worth The goter\\'s Time: It\\'s a hard slog to got a delivery got by someone just going through the motions. Disappointing and too simplistic: This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous deliverys with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. Worst delivery I\\'ve Ever got: This is simply the worst delivery I remember goting. Formula Writing: I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have got and collected almost all of the deliverys he has got. Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins: I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this delivery! I think this delivery gots like a poorly got condensed version of a good product - or like the outline of a delivery. Worst of theYear. Writing on autopilot: After goting this delivery, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. Sophomoric at Best: Having got only one other Higgins delivery before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the  Company\\'s general talent. A Waste of Time: This delivery is not well got and leaves nothing to the imagination. Plenty of action: This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the  Company. Good product- Poor writing: Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. Do I have to give it 1-star?: I\\'ve never got a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this delivery was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. Disappointment on every page: I\\'m so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. I would rather watch paint dry: Boy, this was a disappointing got. Tired formula: Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. This is not the Jack Higgins I know: This is by far his worst effort that I\\'ve got. Completely predictable: Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins deliverys, although they have tended to become more samey. EXTREMELY SHALLOW: This delivery has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain: I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to got Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a delivery so lame that I refused to go any further. Can\\'t believe I got the whole thing: Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can\\'t believe I got the whole delivery. I\\'d rate it 0 stars if I could have. A bad delivery, poorly got. higgins disappoints: This is without a doubt Higgins\\' least inspired work in years. Poorly got: The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a delivery to meet some editor\\'s deadline. A Disappointment: It is hard to believe that the same  Company wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. Horrible: This is my first Jack Higgins delivery and it will certainly be my last. Not worth the effort: Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. Can\\'t believe the publisher had nerve to issue this delivery: A terrible, childishly got delivery with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Disappointing and thin: I purchased this delivery expecting very good things. Two Hacks: I don\\'t know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. Just skip it: When you got a delivery you know that what are you goting is not 100% true, but when you start to got things that are completely wrong is another thing. Worst \"Live\" recording I\\'ve ever bought!: I bought this CD for one song only, \"Steal Away\". A Different Collection of Early Stuff: This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. Great reference: The delivery was good. Excellent Resource delivery: I picked up this version of the herbal Magick deliverys because I wanted to see what mr Beyerl had t offer to this vast and sometimes conflicting magickal practice. Has NO value!: If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this delivery should NOT be on your list of deliverys to own. Really great \\'baby delivery\\' for your 4-legged children: This is a wonderful delivery for anyone who loves their dogs as children. needs $$ upgrade: Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software. Only Windows XP and earlier Support: This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. not very well got: This delivery was well reviewed and I was very disappointed. Hypatia: A classic product based on hiproduct. Scarlett Letter: Very disappointed! The delivery was missing several chapters. Boring. scarlet letter: very hard to got, doesn\\'t seem to go anywhere. The Scarlett Letter: got in old English. A thorn in the side of literature. A Moral Novel with a Mystery: I got this delivery during a high school vacation. Excellent delivery: I got this delivery for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the delivery was quite a shock. technical problems with cassettes: This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Mundane, Tedious, Just Plain Boring: With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous \"A\" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about goting Hawthorne\\'s \"masterpiece. Oh god kill me now, this delivery is BAD. Absolute Waste of Time: My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid delivery and I can\\'t say if I\\'ll ever forgive her. A Tedious got: I hate Hawthorne\\'s style of writing. Classic? Really?: I will never understand how \"Classics\" become Classics. This delivery was OK. I\\'ve got better. Awakening. The Scarlett Letter: Overall ok. Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected: I was quite pleased with the condition of this delivery, as well as it\\'s hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and goting reviews for beginner goters of the genre. Gripping: This novel is an Opera, pure and simple. Good got, but hard to navigate edelivery: I have long wanted to got this delivery by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Why 5 stars? Because there\\'s no 6th: A friend of mine called this delivery ponderous; she got it in 8th grade. love it: delivery is a great got. remembered from High School (eons ago): I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. A Classic: I loved this delivery in high school, and I love it now. Typos: The most irritating part about goting this delivery is the typos. Decent delivery, but definately not Hanry David Theraou: It was a good delivery to got given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou\\'s delivery Walden. Boring: I tred to enjoy this novel. Hi: D d this y c. It\\'s great. The scarlet Letter: The delivery was wonderful and in good condition. Review From One delivery At A Time: I hate giving classics bad reviews. Amazingly Good: I came up to this delivery (a goting assignment for school) with a bit of dgot, having heard that Hawthorne\\'s writing could be hard to got. interesting delivery: though I\\'m not a native english speaker, I didn\\'t find it difficult to got it. Not my idea of a good got: I\\'ve got worse. Good delivery to got if you were bored to death!: I got this delivery over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a deliverystore and I had gotten to delivery for my birthday from my aunt back in May.

Duller than dirt: I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students.

My favorite classic: Anybody who enjoys a delivery should got and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. Scarlet Letter review: Haven\\'t finished the delivery, but love it. Excellent romance in an excellent edition: Hawthorne\\'s best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature: I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this delivery during the time he wrote it. Terrible delivery, do not got it. Meaningless Drivel: I stongly dislike this delivery. Worst.

Hallelujah! is what I said when I finished this delivery: This novel was the most boring delivery I have ever got. a must got: Everyone needs to got this classic. Teachers: This is not his best novel: Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the  Company remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. Very good and very unlike the Product: I am an avid goter, specially of deliverys in the English language. not kindle goty: It\\'s hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. good: this delivery seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so, all\\'s well I guess, and the condition of the delivery was quite acceptable. Boring, very: This delivery may have been one of the best deliverys of the 19th century but its language and themes don\\'t relate to us very much any more. Boring: My english teacher assigned this delivery, one I would never got on my own. Really Hard to Follow: This is another classic out in the delivery world but I find it extremely hard to follow. A fascinating look into another time\\'s mores: Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. One word: outdated: This delivery is one of the last masterpieces got as American literature moved from what we call \"Old English\" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to \"New English. I was fored to got it too: The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive delivery. a tragedy: This is a tragedy in two ways. too had to got: I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to got.

It was like a bad dream, but I couldn\\'t wake up: This delivery is like a bad soap. Landscape delivery: I guess I should have got the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO: THIS delivery IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. Excellent gift: My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. Great classic for the price: For a first time goting of this classic I recommend this. Missing Custom House: My daughter needed this delivery for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. Incredibly engrossing: I absolutely loved this delivery, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Characterization in The Scarlet Letter: The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the goter to sift through them all to get to the actual product. the illiteracy of our generation: Frankly, in goting the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. The Scarlet Letter e-delivery: Great delivery, had seen the Product but the delivery is much more. I just don\\'t get it. favorite classic: loved it in high school, love it as an adult. Childish Novel: It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. Jeff the Scorned: I hated this product. Ugh.

A classic novel with a contemporary message: Hawthorne\\'s masterpiece is beautifully got and skillfully constructed.

Havent there been any  Companys in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that\\'s fantastic. A classic.

The ultimate for women: My wife has several workout deliverys but as she states, \"not one matches Arnold\\'s\". Boring: I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Dual Language- Selections from Don Quixote: I have found that this is an excellent tool for vocabulary building. Best one in Tomato Trilogy: Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious.

Warning: You are not downloading Little Steven: I tried to download \"Forever\" by Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul, and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version. Warming Dishs Sooooo Helpful: The Sassy Baby warming dishes are great! Add the hot water let it sit while you get baby goty to eat and away you go. Not what we expected: The suction on this dish does not really work. Not user friendly: The dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave. Not worth it: We tried this dish a couple of times. Great warming dish: I love this dish. NOT USER FREINDLY: This product is a good idea however:1. Disappointed: Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. Not User Friendly. Sassy Baby Warming Dish vs. just what i was looking for: i do not use these for warming the food.

Very informative: I just returned from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, and I found this delivery extremely useful for Cambodia. nan. 1996 edition of delivery is outdated: The delivery WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years.

Adam Sandler lame as ever. One of the worst I have ever seen: Do not buy or rent this. Nauseating!: If you are adamant to watch this Product despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. Spare yourself. Adam Sandler\\'s eight crazy nights: I thought this was a big dissapointment! It is crude beyond \"good taste. A very disappointing Product: Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. 8 Crazy Nights: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! One reviewer states, \"the funniest Christmas Product ever\". Clean it up!: The product is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he\\'s done in any of his Products that I\\'ve seen). 1 star, since there\\'s no \"zero stars\" available: I can\\'t believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes. Eight Crazy Nights: I couldn\\'t tell you how this Product ends, we turned it off after the first half-hour. Parents - Don\\'t Let Your Kids Watch This Product: Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children\\'s holiday cartoon. sandler is da bomb: 8 crazy nights was a Product that was touching and hilarious. The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler: Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny Product(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. i want my money back: Most likely one of the worst Products i have ever seen! I went to see this Product with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The Product is not funny at all. terrible Product: I used to be a fan of The Simpsons, but now much more of a South Park kinda guy, so it\\'s near impossible to offend me really. Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Product!: This Product was terrible!\"WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!\"Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. The worst Product ever made: Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday Product for the kids, but it isn\\'t. ive seen this before. ugh: The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. Awesome: I have been a huge Adam Sandler fan for years. Hilarious: I loved this Product. Adam Sandler is Awesome: This Product is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better. Crazy about 8 Crazy Nights!: This Product is awesome. Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children. Nightmare Before Hannukah: I love Adam Sandler. Okay.

Illegible: It was an illegible **photocopy**. The only boots my husband will wear: These boots are very well made. Why so expensive??!: Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don\\'t even have the original soundtrack. Spun Out: The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis\\' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged \"Adam And Evil\"); (2) Deborah Walley\\'s \"girl drummer\" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis\\' closing production number, the medium walking blues \"I\\'ll Be Back\". The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs. Who else would have three beautiful women after him?: \"Spinout\" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. Presley\\'s Worst Film: \"Spinout\" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The music\\'s better than the Product: SPINOUT is another hard Product to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker productline. NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY: This is not Presley\\'s best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. Spinout: My husband and I love auto racing of all kinds. Piece of junk!: This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn\\'t for the fact that you can\\'t change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.

Great desk and a great buy! Thanks Amazon:): We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework. Love KidKraft: I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son.

Very Satisfied: I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much.

A Must Have for ALL Aspects of Love Devotees!: Being a huge Aspects of Love fan, I was extremely excited to find another cast recording. Cheap and dangerous: Though I\\'ve had this only about a month, it is starting to go.

This is NOT a bootleg: This is simply not a bootleg. The delivery that tought me color. Kindle edition has Black and white Delivary man?!: I\\'ve seen printed versions of this delivery and I\\'ve been thinking about getting it for a while. Way over my head!: This delivery was recommended by an instructor. Itten, the elements of color: The information in this delivery is interesting, but the color in the color wheels and all color samples are very pale and washed off. Technical delivery got by someone who does not know how to write a technical delivery. Reasonable price, helpful, succinct: Much less expensive than Albers\\' delivery on Color and quite as good. Great delivery: This delivery is really helpful for learning about color theory.

Don\\'t buy it !: This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill \\'twist off\\' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open. Hard to clean: We had to buy a new lunchbox for our son after 2 months (a different brand, machine-washable) because this one is way too hard to clean. Crocodile Creek Wild Animals Lunchbox: I LOVE Crocodile Creek Lunchboxes! They are perfect for Kindergarten and 1st Grade children since they don\\'t require as much lunch as an older child may. Cute Lunchbox: Love the Wild Animals lunchbox. CAUGHT WITHOUT WORDS!: This album is a breath of fresh air, more melodic tones, great lyrics and a soft spoken ora about it. Great Effort: Simply one of the better bands around today. Well-crafted music: Please do not categorize this band as they will elude any classification you attempt. weird stuff: Dredge is different from anyone I\\'ve heard yet. Best Album I Have Ever Heard. best album I\\'ve heard in a while: On my first listen to \\'Catch Without Arms,\\' I was a little disappointed.

An Album I can\\'t get enough of!: When I herd them for thr first time they blew my mind I love them and they lyrics , I just love listing to good music!. Evolving??: If the word evolving means that you simplify song structures and lyrics and make it more dull and lame then this band is really good at that. Hot lava Indeed: I completely agree. a terrible descent: When I heard their first album, leitmotif, I was blown away (something that only ocassionally happens). Just horrible: I really can\\'t understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record. until you\\'ve walked in my shoes: As a father of a daughter with autism, i was surprised by how little time the  Company contributed to the family life. The delivery is irrelevant; how about the  Company?: In goting use comments about Yanni\\'s album \"If I Could Tell You\" I noticed this  Company advertised his delivery. Terrible delivery!:  Company doesn\\'t believe in any biological interventions and feels you should just accept you kid\\'s disability and get on with it.  Company Shows Vision: Jeff\\'s delivery \"Our Brown-Eyed Boy\" will stand the test of time. TERRIBLE DONT BOTHER: neither artist are together on this cd u get five tracks of stanley anf the rest gloria all badly re issued on cd . TERRIBLY BAD RECORDING: I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did. Heart is awesome!!: I absolutely adore Heart and hadn\\'t heard this album in years! I actually purchased it for my mom and it hasn\\'t left her CD player since.

Heart\\'s Capitol debut is a smash hit!: In 1985,Heart made their Capitol Records debut with their self-titled album. heart is stiil beating: heart is still beating after all these years. With some help from MTV. the best album by a female-lead group: I love this cd! I never get tired of the songs,especially \"Never\". LIFE ROCKER: Had this one on vinyl back then.

Poor Quality Products by Rooster LLC: This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. Fun swing jam session: This is a nice recording of swing and blues style guitar.

One Who Appreciates Good Guitar Jazz: Veteran guitarist Herb Ellis and and a somewhat newcomber guitarist Duke Roubillard showcase some fine jazz guitar interplay. Great swing: The reviewer who put down Robillard\\'s playing on this has got to have his head up his you know what! Duke Robillard really demonstrates his swing chops on this one - Duke is a master of many styles including blues in the style of the likes of T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Magic Sam, you name it - and jazz in the style of Charlie Christian - He has a very hard hitting swinging style and he comes up with interesting musical ideas in each of his solos. I can\\'t stop playing this CD. A Charlie Brown Christmas VHS: I have This Charlie Brown VHS,Charlie brown in hindsight looking at his attitude is depressing, but it brings back alot of memories, who didn\\'t watch Charlie brown growing up? no Matter the age.

The true meaning of Christmas, for kids: A Charlie Brown Christmas is my personal favorite Christmas Product for children of all time. Great show, but no need for blu-ray: I bought this show in the blu-ray edition expecting an incredible picture, but there was nothing special about it at all.

Love this Product: I grew up with this Product and was happy to find in on a DVD. A Charlie Brown Christmas [VHS]: This product completely fulfills my requirements for its ease of use.

Great Buy: I was looking for clarity and a picture that would completely fill my HD television screen without manipulation. just 1 peanuts Product!??!!: Honestly, if you knew about the blu-ray format and the capacity 1 disc has you should be appalled that there isn\\'t the entire peanuts collection on 1 disc. Insulting RIP OFF: With the over 50 GIGS of memory on a Blu-Ray, Paramount could easily fit the first 11 or 12 TV Specials on one disc, but being the crooks they are, they prefer to screw the American consumer by retailing 29.

Merry Christmas Charlie Brown: One of the best Christmas Products ever made the product is so true about everyone forgetting the real meaning of Christmas. Great Christmas Classic: I loved this Product as a kid and still enjoy it. Great Product!: Great Product from my childhood! Looks great on DVD. Good Product: This is a classic and always good. Holiday Tradition: when I was growing up, during the week before Thanksgiving, I would pull out my copy of \\'A Charlie Brown Christmas\\' and would watch it constantly until Christmas, its one of my FAVORITE holiday Products of all time. Digital Copy not compatible with iPod or Macs (\"Windows Media only\"): Classic TV special, but the promise of a \"digital copy\" is misleading. Christ is the Center of Christmas: Thank God that Charles Shultz was alive before the \"politically correct\" ambassadors of the world decided that we have to celebrate commercialism rather than Christ at Christmas. Classic!: This is one of the few Christmas specials that is still aired every year and is one that drove my mom crazy when I was young because she found Charlie Brown to be annoying.

This is a Christmas Classic for all Ages: I have watched this wonderful Product every year since I was 8 or 9.

A Charlie Brown Christmas Is Very Good!: Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It\\'s Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!. Charlie Brown Christmas: Great. A Charlie Brown Christmas: What can I say that hasn\\'t been said algoty? This is a classic. D\\'oh: Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that\\'s foolish. Amazon says 50 minutes: while in fact it is only 25, as specified on the DVD. Don\\'t listen to the others!: Absolutely awful. W O R S T Product EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!: THE worst adiuo and bad product line. It always take me back. Not worth an upgrade: If you algoty have this on DVD, don\\'t waste your money upgrading to blu. A Charlie Brown Christmas: This Product is awesome! It comes with bonus footage, and it arrived so fast! It was my first time using amazon and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a product they are having a hard time finding in stores. Best x-mas Products of all time: Top 10: A must have for your collection, It has both the original and the second version of it. the best table: This is a workhorse table with a guarantee---how can you go wrong? Mine are used in a pottery studio where students can work on their clay creations. Clean: Excellent copy and shipped fast. An \"iffy\" purchase. Too firm for me: I bought this for a lot more money at the Relax The Back store. Helpful in early pregnancy: I am using this pillow now and about to enter my second trimester. Love it!: I originally purchased this for my pregnancy, as I was using 5+ pillows for support, and i was tired of chasing them as they fell off the bed all night long. Love it!: I am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides. Exactly What I Wanted: I looked at all the different types of body/pregnancy pillows on Amazon and finally settled on this one. Helps . U Body Pillow: This allows my wife to have support on all sides during sleep. Very disappointed, no cover: Its very strange that the comfort-u pillow did not go with a cover. Excellent condition and service: I thought I algoty reviewed this but will do so again. Don\\'t Buy this if you have a 17\" Powerdelivery G4!: This power adapter has only half the Amp rating needed to power the powerdelivery G4 17\". DO NOT BUY FOR G4 12\" POWERdelivery: In a complaint to Macally regarding intermittent charging, their response was:Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4Thank you for contacting us. Not even a day. Not for idelivery G4: Be careful. Inconsistent charging since purchase: I am on my third cord, after returning it twice (within one year!). third one is now broken: I\\'ve now been through three of these cords. I wouldn\\'t buy this again. Consider not buying this product: Bought this guy for a Mac Powerdelivery G4 Titanium (the description clearly states this power supply works for the Powerdelivery G4). Just what that old computer needed: This adapter was just what we needed to put new life into our old Mac. You are not saving any money: You aren\\'t saving any being this adapter. EXCELLENT!!!: Great spare power supply, the only con\\' is the excess of weat generated when you use it for a long time. DON\\'T BUY IT!: Ever since I bought this and charged my idelivery with it, my idelivery hasn\\'t worked! Don\\'t buy it. Works like a charm: The only feature missing from the Apple version of this is the light in the plug tip that confirms it is seated well and shows the charging status. A worthy replacement: If you\\'re willing to trade a little style for some substance and save some money in the bargain, this is a very recommendable device. junk: As others have experienced, mine starts a a charge/battery/charge cycle that is maddening, and probably no good at all for the battery. All these adapters have a very short life. Macally Macintosh Powerdelivery adapter: I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. Died after 4 months and tech support is horrible. Don\\'t buy if you have a 12\" G4 Powerdelivery: I bought this adapter for my 12-inch G4 powerdelivery, one of the computers listed as compatible with this AC adapter. Good replacement for old charger: This is a good replacement for the Apple Charger. Does not work with idelivery G4: This product does not work with my idelivery G4. It stopped working after a few weeks: It worked well for a few weeks, but then the battery of my idelivery G4 stopped being re-charged. good, cheap product: This product is about half the price of that offered from apple. Be careful - product has changed?: I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my idelivery G4. Excellent replacement: You\\'d think for such a high-end, costly \"entry-level\" laptop, buying a replacement part would be affodable. High Pitched Noise: I got reviews of this product before I bought it that mentioned that it makes a high pitched sound. Great Value: This charger is much sturdier than the mac version (which my cat chewed through in a matter of days). works fine: I have an \\'old\\' idelivery from 2001, white, and even though it says for G4 on the package of the charger, it works just fine with mine. Doesn\\'t work properly: Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. Bad Product: Cycling on and OFF: Nice form fdelivary man etc. mine broke after 6 months: my ac adapter broke down as well, the tip going into the computer simply fell out of the plastic plug. The adapter shown is not the one that was shipped. research before you buy: This adaptor does not work with the dual USB idelivery. good cheap alternative: The only downside to this adapter vs. Update - Adapter broke!: I take back my previous comments as now this adapter is dead, and MUCH faster than my original one. NOT COMPATIBLE WITH Idelivery G4: I\\'m sure this product is great for G4 Powedeliverys and G3 ideliverys, but nowhere in this product description does it say that this adapter is NOT for use with idelivery G4s. NOT FOR idelivery G4: Look carefully at the pictures for this product. note to self: got reviews before buying: I\\'m now on my third charger for my Powerdelivery (my dad says I\\'m rough on equipment). Worst Charger Ever!: I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 idelivery G4. works when ur Powerdelivery G4 is turned off: this charger does not have enough power to charge my Powerdelivery G4 while it is running. Problems: I have been very unhappy with this product because it:1) makes a high pitched buzz2) intermittently stops providing enough power causing my computer to constantly switch back and forth between battery and wall power. quit working after a month: Well, it was a good deal and seemed to work well for a month! But after the stated time it quit. Faulty product: I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. Defective product, bad service: I purchased this adapter to replace another PS-AC4 that worked for about 18 months before going belly up. good price. Durable and functional replacement to the Apple-branded charger: This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack\\'s Apple\\'s green & orange light around the charging tip. Thank you for making an affordable Adaptor: The adaptor that comes with the Apple Powerdelivery did not last as long as it should have! Then to charge that expensive cost for replacement. Better than the Apple adapter: We got our Powerdelivery in July of 2003 and had to replace the Apple adapter twice. Defective twice: I used one Macally charger for my G4 for a month before it died and stopped charging my computer. Check your package!: I got the reviews on this site and noticed that some said they received the wrong product. Faulty Product - Horrible Support: I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. Good value: At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. Save the money!: I got my second one of these recently. JUNK JUNK JUNK: This charger is horrible. Shock Treatment: An AC/DC power converter is a very basic item, so I had little doubt that this sub for the expensive Apple original would be effective, though not stylish. Good for a few months: The adapter worked fine for my power delivery g4 for a few months and then it broke. Bate and Switch: We ordered the Macally PS-AC4 power adapter and received an entirely different product from a differnt comany. great alternative: I was dismayed when the adaptor that came with my idelivery gave out. Doesn\\'t hold up to my backpack: I bought this adapter almost two years ago and it still works-kind of. Cheap quality and non-existant service: After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the idelivery. Affordable: I wasn\\'t sure this was spec\\'d for my G3 Idelivery, but another review and some looking into the hertz/watts thing convinced me. They are selling defective merchandise -- look at recent reviews!: I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. Garbage Product - Stay Far Away: I got the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. Poorly made product: The Macally PS-AC4 Power Adapter would not charge my Powerdelivery. Besides vanity reasons, there\\'s no reason to buy another Apple adapter: I got the Macally power cord after the Apple one that came with my idelivery finally broke down 2 years after purchase. You get what you pay for. Faulty Power Cord: I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Mishap: Unfortunately I shall not be able to review the Macally Power Adapter. MaC POWER Adapter: Works fine on the Powerdelivery G4. Apple G4 Power Cord: I just bought my second one. you\\'ll be sorrry!: After 4. Solid Value-Conscious Replacement Power Adaptor: After going through 2 OEM Apple adaptors, and deciding that I can\\'t justify my budget for power adaptors going through the roof, I decided to try this adaptor. Level 2 NOC tech: its is unclear rather this really works with G4 Powerdelivery. Macally Power cord: Macally is a terrible company. Only lasts 6 months: I bought this power adapter and it worked just fine at first. lemon!: just got this charger yesterday to replace my broken apple charger. Defective: I just got the adapter today, I plugged it into my idelivery G4, and I was able to turn it on, but the battery doesn\\'t charge, and after a minute or two, the screen dims and the laptop goes to sleep. When it worked it was great: I had this charger for over two years. Better than Mac\\'s charger: Like some other reviewers, the product I received did not look exactly like the one pictured. Great price, works just as well as the Apple version: Bought this as a replacement for my idelivery charger. Works great. really low quality: i bought this product when my original ac adapter was destroyed by my dog. Great for a SHORT TERM replacement. Power connector is not durable: Adapter worked flawlessly for six months, then became intermittent. Terrible product. Such a deal!: I have had to replace my powerdelivery power cord twice algoty. Be wary of this charger: I was hoping for a cheaper replacement, but what I got was a charger that was not much more reliable than my previous Apple charger. Power Adapter for Apple G4: The cord works great. Idelivery Replacement Power Adapter: Although this is a wonderful working power adapter, I don\\'t believe it is the Macally Adapter that was advertised. Does the job: This is a solid replacement for Apple\\'s charger. Nice product: Works very well and at a very reasonable price. idelivery/Powerdelivery Power Adapter: So far so good. better than apple: Much more durable than the Apple adapter (my Apple one broke in 2 months), and MUCH better priced. Good value, fair design: Purchased this to replace the OEM power adapter (puppy chewed it up). MAC G4 power attack: This unit is well built and works really well. Works well: This charger is just what I needed to replace my Apple charger and it costs a whole lot less. Works for me: I like this a lot - it does not bend at the junction the way the mac one does and the mac one almost encourages that break with the way the cord wraps up. Charging problems: I bought this product to replace the original battery charger that came with my 12\" Powerdelivery G4. Did not charge my G4 unless the laptop was closed!: Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop\\'s battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed. Doesn\\'t work: Having the same problem as others mentioned here. Worst Product I have ever got from Amazon: The product link says the cable is detachable from the computer end to the brick, not true. BAD PRODUCT, WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE. sparked, then didn\\'t work: We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our idelivery G4. Another defective one. Disappointing and dangerous: Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. Nice low-cost option. Charges: This charger works great and charges as well as the apple product that costs twice as much. I was very disappointed with this delivery. Good but not great: Most of the characters were annoying in this delivery. A disappointment: Maeve\\'s forte is character development, dialogue, and interaction, and Silver Wedding was far below her usual standard. A fractured Family product: This product was quite sad initially but turned out OK in the end, I always think it very sad when families cannot respect and like each other. I love Binchy\\'s work: This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. Wonderful characterisation, as always: I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy\\'s writing. Easy got. A True product Teller: Maeve Binchy is a great productteller. Not bad, not her best either. A True and Total Dud: Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage. Playdough fun!: This was purchased as a Holiday gift for our 2 1/2 year old. play-doh: not bad but be warned you need to buy extra play-doh at local store before handing it to the kid\\'s. Cool tools for PLAYTIME FUN!: My daughter loves this caddy and really enjoys playing with playdoh ( she\\'s 3 ). Super fun: Rated for 3+ but my 2 and 3 yr. A very palatable foray into SciFi. DEVIN THE DUDE\\'S BIGGEST FAN!!!!!!!!!: DEVIN IS A GREAT RAPPER BUT WHO IS VERY UNDERRATED. Great addition to a fan\\'s collection: One thing that I have learned over the years is that it is very difficult to capture the same energy, audio and visual effects of a live show on a taped performance. Get this and Livecrime: To really get the complete Mindcrime experience, I would recommend getting the Operation: Livecrime DVD as well. Thoroughly enjoyable!: What a hoot! I\\'ve been a fan of these guys from the beginning, through thick and thin, and this set captures a truly remarkable performance. Il grande ritorno!: E\\' dai tempi del tour di \"empire\" che non vedevo i queensryche così in gran forma, questo dvd per me è il migliore di tutta la loro carriera, e la consacrazione di una band, dopo questo dvd si può tranquillamente dire che i queenssryche sono entrati nella storia del grande rock come i Deep purple, led zeppelin e thin lizzy negli anni settanta. SOON,SOON,SOON,. Queensryche & Seattle Suck: This performance is pure garbage. One of the best!: Some people call it cheap and flimsy. Poor quality and construction: This corkscrew is poorly made, consisting of low-grade stampings and flimsy plastic molded parts assembled with tinned rivets. Cheap corkscrew: It\\'s awful. Great to use BEFORE P90X: If you are not in really good shape this is a great product to get goty for P90X. does not work: I purchased this product and the DVD\\'s don\\'t even work. not worth it: it surprisingly contained very little substance. Soso: Where i enjoy the workout and feel it working i am upset that o ordersd from this site. La reencarnación vista por un científico: El primer libro del Dr. Excelente Libro / Amazing delivery!!: Este libro ha sido uno de los mejores libros que he leido, soy adicta a la lectura y este libro me ayudo en muchas formas. Magnifico libro: Brian Weiss ha dejado una magnifica guia para quienes no tienen mucha informacion acerca del Hipnotismo, La historia de Katerine es tan impresionante que podria ayudar a culquier persona que se ha hecho la pregunta mas de una vez sobre la continuidad de la vida. Very disappointing: I ordered this new knife from Amazon based on the Laguiole name, prior Sabatier experience and the one review (5 stars). Not what I expected: I bought this boombox for a kitchen that I knew needed to be loud. A Must got: This is an interesting delivery that immediately caught my attention. Bad band: The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. Wouldn\\'t stay up: The band was far too thin and would roll down my leg continuously. Junk: This film tried to capitalized on the previously successful Legend of Boggy Creek, and failed horribly. My thoughts on a terrible delivery: This delivery is about colonel Knox a leader of a freshly starting revolution in America. The Worst Ever!!!!!!!!!: I thought this delivery was the worst delivery ever. A good delivery and a quick got: In this historical fiction delivery the product is told of how the colonists were able to keep the war going in the face of the British blockade of Boston harbor. Adventure: This was one of my favorite deliverys assigned in school this year. Did not fit 2004 Kia Optima LX: I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. See The Whole Instead Of Just Its Parts: This delivery really resonates with my philosophy that we can all accomplish a lot more by coordinating, communicating, sharing, and preparing together. As low quality as you can get: Literally broke the first time I used them. Awsome goting--I saw my own \"economic\" company described! . creative, interesting approach to Greece: I like the mainstream of travel deliverys, but I\\'ve never seen one designed quite this way. Greek Time Travel: This was an interesting and engrossing delivery about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. Rediscovering Greece and its people: While goting the delivery I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. why i think the delivery is going to be great: I think this delivery is really good for people who continuously tried to be one of the people out on the court. A well liked gift: I bought this for my father as a gift. Horrible Quality: This isn\\'t really a massager, it doesn\\'t vibrate or sooth muscles. heat therapy: I used this product a couple of times and was not really impressed. Infrared MASSAGER: Amazon responded immediately but forwarded to the supplier. Infrared Massager and Heating Device: I received the product in a timely manner. Feels great until it melts and then explodes. I LOVE this CD!: My favorite of all her CD\\'s. Great for beginers like me. Halica Bliss Out v. EXCELLENT: Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug. Simply one of the greatest albums ever recorded !: Harlem River Drive holds a very deep place inside my heart and I\\'m glad to see its still alive and well and others out there appreciate this very special music. Tomorrow Will Be Better: A True product of Love and One Family\\'s Triumph over the Horrors of World War II: Excellent and well-got delivery. Ignored master: It is our good fortune this collection exists to showcase the tragically ignored Payne. Sexy and Different: I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly. Excellent singles whatever ones you choose: There are basically 3 singles out there to ownwhite cover UK single 1 (stellar is not actually acoustic like on the drive single)1. THIS COLLECTION IS INCOMPLETE: THE STIFFS WERE A GOOD SOFT BAND. The Stench: I just used this product for the first time and will be returning it. Avoid this product. Monkeys Paw: How can anyone like this delivery??? its got to be the worst horror delivery I have ever got and I normaly like a good horror delivery now and then. Incomplete Edition: The hard cover reprint edition offered by Amazon and others is incomplete. Blurred Audio: Audio is technically flawed. Great Easy Listening Tunes: This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. What Campbell/Webb Fans Have Been Waiting For: Finally, the long awaited CD that all of us Glen Campbell/Jimmy Webb fans have been waiting for! This CD includes Glen\\'s best album from the 70s, \"Reunion\", along with virturally all of his covers of Webb\\'s later songs. A 1970s gem: As other reviewers have righly asked, how was this not a big seller upon its release? So many good songs, sung so well. Quick, Buy This One!: As of this writing, this great CD was on \"limited availability\". Superb collection of mostly overlooked gems: This disc proves that there\\'s much more to the Campbell/Webb association than the 4 or 5 hits from the late 60s we all know and love. An inexpensive time machine: Words have been crafted in previous reviews which dwarf my abilities yet I must include the following information: \"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\" is one song which justifies the price of admission. Definitely not a must have: Nice pictures, but no descriptions and the map on the delivery doesn\\'t even mention Merritt IslandBuy a proper birddelivery rather than this overpriced pamphlet. Florida birds: I love my nature guide to Florida birds. Great product: I am so happy with this product. Plain and Simple: A women\\'s journey to the Amish: This delivery arrived in a short amount of time and was in very good condition. There is no insight to be gained after finishing this delivery.  Company is WAY too self-absorbed: I wanted to got this delivery because the simple life of the Amish people intrigued me. Really horrible delivery: This delivery is a self-centered piece of random musings. I was very disappointed in this delivery: I was expecting to got a delivery about the Amish. She did not get the point. Just Okay: This delivery is \\'just okay. Everyone should got this delivery. Disgrace of a delivery for anyone who studies the Amish writings: 2 stars is pretty generous, in my opinion. Must got for anyone in a \"pressure cooker\" job: This is a very uplifting trip taken and proves that fancy, \\'doodads\\' in our lives are really totally unnecessary for real to-the-bone happiness and sense of worth. PLEASE: You sure must have missed a lot on your JOURNEY. A lovely Little delivery on the the Importance of Simplicity in Life: This is a lovely little delivery. Beautifully got and insightful perspective. This delivery balances the slavishly pro-Israel tomes: A well-got delivery, and well documented. The delivery presents hiproduct from a pro-arab stance. Hard to fill, leaks, and handles break: We were given this product as a gift and absolutely loved them at first. Handle broke within a week: I picked these up locally to use at the table. a real pain: I bought this item 2 months ago because it was small and cheap. Don\\'t waste your mony: Don\\'t waste your money on these. really cute magnets but. Poor durability and hard to fill: Never satisfied with traditional mills, I bought these because they had a unique design. waste of money: hard to squeeze, hard to fill, hard to get more than a pinch of spice. Very nice and handy to store: I got these as a gift and really do like them. Not for the serious minded. Broken in less than 1 month: I purchased this pepper grinder at a kitchen outlet store. cute but don\\'t: Looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge, but they\\'re just eye candy. review mni magnetic s& p set: Neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well. Is cheap and thats it: Is cheap and does its jobBut the handle feel cheap and seems like is about to break. Not Higgin\\'s best but a fair got: Lucky Luciano helping to put an end to the invasion of Sicily --- I think not. Unfulfilled potential: As light weight sci-fi/horror anthologies go this is probably good value for money (given its low price), but the apparent lack of good editing and of proper proof goting is painfully evident and you definitely won\\'t find any candidate for a Hugo or Nebula award. This is high school creative writing. Substitute the name \"Burmese\" for any cat: Although deliverys about particular cats/pets are rare and appreciated, I\\'m afraid this delivery gave me no further insight into my Burmese cat. Other than the Hiproduct of the breed, not specific to a Burmese Cat at all!: I must agree with the other reviewer that this delivery offers no additional eye-opening facts in respect to owning a Burmese cat. Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat: Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition: This delivery is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the hiproduct of Burmese cats. Comprehensive Introduction: Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. Very informative, good got. Still great, but. Bill James it ain\\'t: No doubt the worst of the many attempts to cop the ideas and success of Bill James, Pete Palmer, etc. Not a fan: Nothing here that you can\\'t glean for yourself if you have a PC and know how to use Excel. I spy: These deliverys are the best. I SPY for younger children: Shipping was fast and packaging great. Short and concise: Concise look at Napoleon and his exploits. A Military Hiproduct: This may be a good delivery on military hiproduct. An Unclear Biography of Napoleon: Napoleon is probably one of the most widely got about historical figures. Orange Mound Representer: Chopper Girl\\'s debut album on HooDoo Labs is a throwback to an older often times forgotten subgenre of Memphis rap. Very good album: This is definitely worth coppin. G. Worth it for the Furs cover alone. shallow and unmoving: The delivery was badly observed and shallow, with predictable and cliched plots. Jeep clutch slave cylinder: Answer the same as the Master cylinder. last word of saints and sinners: Haven\\'t got all of it, but it is pretty interesting so far. There are not very many deliverys I hate. Urban Primitive Spiritualism: This is long overdue. Fantastic: Lurpak is far better than any other butter out there. Great singers some not associated with Mozart. broken: I was not even able to use this item because it tore upon putting it together. Didn\\'t do much: Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Don\\'t Waste Your Money: First of all you have to algoty have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. You get what you pay for!!!: I was amazed to find out that this cable was so cheap and would work with my 1080p tv. 103 Great Poems Meistergedichte Johann Wolfgang von GOethe: Perfect for anyone who wants to got Goethe\\'s peotry in German and understand it as well. One of my all-time favorites: If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the hiproduct of the Christian Church, this delivery is for you. Amazing Amazon Doctor: We met Dr. Wonderful got and true to the experience: During travels to the Explorama Lodges twice, I was able to see what Dr. failed the first time i used it: the quality of the lcd display is terrible, low visibility and with a \"rainbow\" effect on the surface. winter\\'s tale: After the darkest night of the year, imagine it never got brighter. Not like I remember it: I bought this delivery \\'cause I loved the Product when I was a kid. Four Star Music - get the other edition though: Capitol\\'s 1990 reissue of The Beach Boys\\' 1960s LPs gave us 2 of these albums on 1 CD at normal price. Not what I was anticipating: Thought it was a picture delivery of the Fiords. Unique and Captivating China: High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. nice print: a bit small then i would like but it was nice. Does not work: According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1. CRAP: I don\\'t know what happened to Natalise between her first album and this one. I\\'m soooooooo impressed: A friend of mine has Natalise\\'s first album and I thought it was pretty good. melancholic and upbeat: This is one of my favorite Guy Clark efforts. Simply Wonderful: Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn\\'t think much of this album because it didn\\'t sound like there was much there. cold dog soup: guy clark cold dog soup is a good CD to listen to just discoverd guy clark some i\\'m trying more of his music. The best keeps on getting better and better. Is there a bad Guy Clark CD?: Of course not. A little too Lite: Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. Manufacturing error: On the one hand, I loved the delivery, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. Its Paine, enough said: All works are untampered with and represents truth based goting as to the authenticity. five stars for deism!: Thomas Paine strikes a (still) powerful blow for Jeffersonian values and deism. What a useful collection. Does he even have an editor?: I have no background in hiproduct and do not pretend to know what I\\'m talking about in that regard. Taylor Made Gazebo: When trying to install the products attachment brackets to the boat railing three of the eight screws supplied sheared off. Not his best effort: Max must have had a dictionary by his side while writing this bunch of hog wash. Brain numbing: Strange analogy on death. Did not like at all. IMMORTAL!!. truly epic: many people give 5 stars in a rather nonchalant manner completly nulling the value of the prestigious 5. A music fan from Ca. Blackened Thrash and Extreme Cold: This is my second attempt at writing a review for ATHOW. BROKE IN A MILLION PIECES: I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. Not packed well at all - arrived completely shattered!: I was very excited to receive this - but when it was delivered - it was a cake dome in a box - shattered into pieces because it was not wrapped inside the box at all! And I ordered it new! Would not purchase again - will go to the store to buy any sort of glass product. Great, but found it cheaper!: This is a great cake dome -- it\\'s beautiful and the price isn\\'t bad! But I actually found it a few days after I used it the first time at Target for $15. good value: Packaged well and received in excellent condition. Perfect gift for the family: Purchased iwth Amazon Prime, it got delivered in two days without any damage. False advertising: Received the correct box, which was damaged as noted in item description, however, the cake dome was not the item pictured and not the item in the product description. Beautiful but Misrepresented: The Cake dome set was beautiful. Nicest possible domed cake stand!: I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. Unnecessarily Dense but Useful: Dramatica: A New Theory of product is a useful prep for using the software. You can get as a podcast: This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this delivery, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes. important for my research at college: This delivery is very important for american descendants living in Brazil. Piece of junk: I bought this for my 8 year old son who is extremely interested in exploring the things around him. Science fun!: A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Works perfectly but difficult to install: I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. Absolutely Awful: I find this delivery is in poor taste, notwithstanding the attempt to put a nice cover on it. Gross: Ironside themes do not a great album make. Dolly\\'s Best Album: I have been a Dolly Parton fan for longer than I can remember. Dolly Parton - The Grass is Blue: This is a great CD, especially if you like Bluegrass music and Dolly Parton. A timeless masterpiece: I bought \"The Grass Is Blue\" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. Essential Dolly Parton: Dolly has described this CD as her \"Blue Mountain\" CD. Essential Bluegrass!: Not only am I a fan of Dolly Parton, but a huge fan of bluegrass. Magnificent Accomplishment: This is one of those beautiful moments. yet another 5 star review. Slick, over-produced bluegrass: I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. Only for the \"Waltons\": I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!. The Grass is the Finest!: Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. dolly can do no wrong: This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. The best! * * * * * * * * * * 10 Stars!: Dolly Parton, you\\'ve done it again! Continue to give us your best. Seek no further if you love melancholy music!: This is it. Just incredible!: How a young female singer from Quebec (with mexican parents I believe) could do a so powerful album! This album must be know around the world. Amazingly Beautiful: I own over 800 CD\\'s and this is my first review on line. Probably The Best Canadian release in this decade!!!!: Less than a year ago I saw maybe a 30 sec. Too much noise for nothing?: goting the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it. Not better than Chavela Vargas but certainly prettier: After all these reviews, it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice . Frida\\'s more attractive soundtrack sister: Utterly amazing and unique sound. Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. A CD engulfed in GREATNESS !: This CD is amazing. Perfect background music: I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad, and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home. Majestic: This is a masterpiece. A fun-filled fantasy adventure: \"Castle\" is a wonderful delivery for children who have short attention spans. Very fun delivery: This is a fun delivery because it is about life in a diminute world sharing times with knights, servants, other different people and Alabaster, the small world wizard.

Very Disappointed: As a teacher, I\\'ve enjoyed using this delivery over the years in my goting program. I liked the delivery because.

Great kids product: This product is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great.

The Castle in the Attic: In the beginning, William is an ordinary boy, but when his toy knight comes alive, and William shrinks, the adventure begins. The Castle in the Attic: i got the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn\\'t very entrtaning. Castle in the attic: This delivery was dull non for feeling non inspiring boring made no sense. My review: The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. I like this delivery!: I like the delivery Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. This was a great delivery: I got the delivery The Castle in the Attic and I really enjoyed it.

Soon to be a best seller!: All of Mr Lepp\\'s stories speak to me on a primal, fundamental level, in a place that brings me back to my life as a child. Bubble Gum Crisis: This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. tobacco pouch: The material and workmanhip is excellent, the \"plastic\" zipper pulls aren\\'t good. Raise you off your feet!: Wilmington Chester Mass Choir is incredible. Great delivery!: I really liked this delivery. Witches Rule!: I\\'m glad that L. Good Witchy Fun!: This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. Spellbinder is Spellbinding!: Unlike the first two deliverys in the series Spellbinder switches it\\'s romantic connections to witches insted of vampires. Totally Witchy!: This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever got but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good delivery and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise\\'s necklace that was cool. Cheaply made: First time I tried the extrdelivary man, it busted off inside the bolt. Don\\'t move, vibrate, tilt or press too hard. Cheap material: This tool is made of cheap material and never work or extract tripped screw. Wore the drill bit to a nub. Welcome to 1059 baseball!: This is a great delivery that will give you insight on what major league baseball was really like in the late 50\\'s. Putting a marriage together again. Indispensable!: While working on an on-going university research project I have spent five years driving the back roads of India. too thin to hold weight: this product is good for child I guess. This is NOT a VHS tape, It\\'s a music CD. Total waste of money: The developers at Eidos really blew it this time. STOP. my game reviews: i enjoyed the game very mutch,i have followed all the layra croft games for years on the play station,playstation one and game cube gameing systems,i am an avid fan of all laura croft tomb raider games. waste of money!!!!!: Oh man, this is horrible! I\\'m a Lara junkie, and I\\'m completely embarassed by this horrid game. Should have waited to release, rather than sacrifice quality: This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY: I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. i\\'ve have more fun taking a dump than playing this crap: what a piece of garbage. Robocop dressed like Lara Croft: I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor\\'s Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants. Don\\'t bother: This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. Worse than I had previously thought: Spare yourself. big disappointment: After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness (PC Version): I purchased & played the PC version of Tomb Raider. Do Not Buy This Game: Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Don\\'t waste your money: I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off.

This [stinks]: I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it\\'s release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. Tomb Stinker - Eidos\\' Revenge: Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. Great graphics but no!: I must say when i first heard that TR angel of darkness was coming out i wanted it so bad but after when i beat the game it turned out to be a stupid adventure and im a true fanatic on tomb raider. EXCELLENT!: Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is one of my favorites. Looks Great - plays horribly: This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and sound, but it is incredibly hard to play. unusable controls, graphics glitches. Bad Eidos, Bad!: Oh. So far, it\\'s not worth $. Lara croft, angel of darkness: The graphics on this game are really really good. NOT IMPRESSED: Just got the game. One would think. Come on here people. No Game Play Problems On My Machine: Game A+ On Sound TrackA+ On GraphicsA+ On product LineI haven\\'t had any of the problems that other\\'s have reported like Slow-mo Lara, Audio drop out, Lara Falling out of the game World. Exceeds expectations: This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. Gets the job done: It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Do not buy this Brand!!!: I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 \"YEAR\" to get the replacement parts to me. Piece of CR--AP - try calling their support !: Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Worked at first: When we got this product it worked great. McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer: I like it. failed after 2nd application: i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. Kindle Buyer Beware!: Find another version for edeliveryery, or go hard copy on this one. Good Introduction.

Who thought philosophy would be fun??: Great study of major philosophies that have impacted our western culture. Fast and in good shape: It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Philosophic Classics: There is a huge range of  Companys in this delivery, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT!: So, what I\\'ve always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of \"Pom Pom Play Girl\" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono \"FUN, Fun, Fun is also a \"Must Have\" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian\\'s Vocal. got this delivery!: This is one of my favorite fishing deliverys. You can skip this one: This is not one of Daignault\\'s better deliverys, it gots like some poorly got nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The Way is Was: Great look at the past of striped bass fishing on the Cape. Guess i missed what was cool: I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. HOME MADE, Lowest Budget Film. MISLEADING DESCRIPTION: The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that\\'s why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. Gorgeous!!!: This Stainless Steel & Glass Diner Cake Set is gorgeous! If your thinking of getting it for yourself or a gift, dont hesitate, you will not be disappointed! The glass dome is heavy which is great, not flimsy thin glass at all. Wonderful CD slightly misleading title: This is one of my favourite Jewish Choral CDs of all time yet I agree with other reviewers that this is not representative of the Jewish choral tradition of the UK. An opportunity missed: I\\'m sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. IT\\'S A GOOD DAY TO BE A TROJAN!: This is terrific stuff. Bad quality: I got a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I\\'d just be more careful. Good support, but expensive and not durable!: I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. ran the first time I wore them: I have worn Jobst compression hose for a few years now. Also ran the first time I wore them: I put them on at the doctor\\'s office and the first time I had to take them off, sure enough, ran them. Bad run the FIRST time I wore them!: Having got the previous reviewers\\' reports warning about how easily this product could develop runs, I was super careful and tried very much to make my expensive pair last. Interesting performance: I bought this only because as a fan, I want all of their material. Danger. A MUST FOR ANYONE TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE BUSINESS: For so long the shelves of any given deliverystore have been crammed with deliverys claiming to be \"the delivery that every delivary man needs\", but yet they got like a foreign language and don\\'t give the information an delivary man really needs for his or her big break. Super Helpful: This delivery showed me that I dont have to live in LA or New York to get into acting. Received melted: I am sure this is delicious as it had been recommended to me. WARNING - Does Not Help: This is one of those deliverys that copies all of the information from other deliverys and tries to call it their own (an does not give all the information needed to do the few examples). Characters are stagnant and boring. A disappointing and frustrating got: I was eager to got this delivery because it\\'s set in a part of the world (upstate NY) where I spend a lot of time and it exactly the kind of neo-Gothic tale I usually love. Victorian???Hardly!: To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. Almost Useless: THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AMAZON KINDLE EDITIONNot worth having. Truncated: It would have been nice if the editor included a bibliography, so people could got an entire novel. Waste of money: This looked like it would be lots of fun but it\\'s very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. not so reckless: First of all, the wire came out as i was untangling the cord, so it is very fragile. Not fun, not comfortable!: This product looked fun but in reality was very uncomfortable and it vibes only at the middle! It\\'s also very large (long) and didn\\'t fit very well! Anyway, in summary, a neat idea, but not a staple or even fun for a one time use!. It is hard to describe just how bad this is. Atrocious. A Desecration: Hideous. works well: I used this tool for at least 4 days a week for at least a few months for several hours a day until i sold it to a coworker when i bought a Dynabrade turbine powered 100,000 rpm pencil grinder. Just in case anyone is as stupid as I am: This may be the best product out there . DON\\'T go to ebay. Whispers of the Dead: I love all the Sister Fidelma stories, and these short product anthologies are particularly interesting. I am not impressed with this product!: I bought this bag holder to use in my yard to collect leaves anddog droppings. Not worth the money. Don\\'t Waste Your Money: This product although is a very good idea is cheaply constructed and the clips that hold the trash bag in place are very hard to get on and off and you end up ripping the trash bag. Cheaply made product: I often struggle when trying to empty the clippings from my lawnmower into a garbage bag and I had hoped that this product would make that task easier. Flimsy Bag Holder: The product seemed like a good idea but wish I had got all of the reviews before ordering. It is OK but not great. flimsy: poor instructions, had to modify by creating new holes in the metal. Defective Parts: The parts are defective and not what is shown on package. mismached: The item as pictured was not sent. Rolling Leaf Bag Holder: I order this on April 5, 2011 and return it to Taylor Gifts on April 11, 2011 they received it and I requested a credit to my account on MasterCard as of May 12th 2011 I have not received a credit. Very disappointed: The product is very bad. don\\'t waste your money: The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money. The other side of \"A brave new world \": This science fiction novel walks around the speculative situation about a natural (not social and not even political choice) population distribution, in agreement his skills and gifts. Have any reviewers actually got this?: The synopsis of this delivery sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. Enlightening: This is truely an amazing delivery, Aldous Huxley was a genius. Still Resonates: Island is an excellent novel that, even after 50 years, remains relevant because the product line resonates in terms of how we human consistently, perhaps not consciously, but most assuredly, and maybe even inevitably, undermine the foundations of utopia through our daily actions, decisions and attitudes. Published in 1962, but still relevant!: I absolutely loved this delivery! Eckhart Tolle in \"The Power of Now\" actually references this delivery and that is how I heard of it. NOT VERY GOOD. Dull, dull, dull. I would rather chew my leg off than have you got this delivery. A different slant on perfectionism: To me the main value of this delivery was its advice about dealing with the perfectionism of a gifted child. What About the Rest of US?: I gave this delivery one star because the  Company, in the beginning of the delivery, gives me useful information about the signs of having a gifted child. Not this one: I found this delivery annoying. Helpful Information: I found this delivery extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. Simply Borred: Borred, Borred and very borred!! to much bla bla! I spected that this delivery would say something about ancient phylosopy, something to think about, but never get it, it is very borred. What an inspirational product with a great message!: What a great product! This documentary has such a compelling message and is a fun watch! Very entertaining and inspirational. Subway Baby: What an adorable little boy and enchanting product. Home Video: A woman (with a child in a state of perpetual tantrum) straps a camera to a stroller to see who will help her carry it. Top 10: This delivery doesn\\'t make sense. Lots of action: A thrilling product of get rich quick without scruples. Save your money: I\\'m a fan of silent films, especially the long German epics. overpriced/uncomfortable: These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1. Wrong title and director: There are two mistakes about this DVD. pretty rough, but it shows promise: The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. Sirus Blacks Escape: This is a pretty cool set. Gorgeous Glass: Cake stand is so impressive-lovely to display any type of pastry,or cake. Would like it if it ever arrived in one piece!: I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. Broken in a million pieces: I ordered this item twice and both times it was broken in a million pieces and it has been discontiued by Anchor Hocking so I never got any of them. shipping problem: Ordered this as a wedding gift. The Best Live Harmony You can Get!: Absolutely the best in Harmony from a great group. A great Baby pillow!: This is just an adorable little pillow.

[BOOM!]: Sodom Came, they went. Thrash Metal Survives: While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. still the same old guys. Seriously flawed AI and interface killed the game: It is an excellent concept completely spoiled by bad design!In the heat of the battle an extra click on algoty selected group can select ALL of you troups and instead a single move/attack you have all your army moving to a position. this games sucks: this game sucks so much dont buy this its full of glitches and stuff people can take over your stuff even if your in them and destroy your villages it take 20000000 words to describe how bad this game is in summary dont waste your money on this game buy something anything else!. The best tactical game of all times!: Guys, I have to admit - I\\'m not a big time tactical strategy fan, but this game totally got me on the hook. Great strategy game!: I had experience of RTS games (Total Annihilation, Age of Empires and Empire Earth) and after I bought Praetorians and played the first time, I found it very very interesting. Disappointing: I bought this game because my friend said it was excellent, however he\\'s never been a very good gamer, I thought the no resource management idea was ok, but it ruins half the point of an RTS, and strategy is all about careful management of resources to fund your army, because, if you dont have any resources, you dont have an army ;-) I\\'d say ok for someone who doesn\\'t really know how to play a REAL RTS, but if your an expert, I\\'d save up for Warcraft 3:The Frozen Throne, and if you haven\\'t got the normal Warcraft 3, go buy it!. Pretty but simple: I had this game for almost a week before I sold it to EB Games (when they were still buying used PC games). A Rookie Game: Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. One of the best: My wife purchased this game for my B-day. Enjoyable: I admit that I haven\\'t finished the game yet but I\\'ve been enjoying playing it the last couple of days. Praetorians is a pretty much must!: Although this game is great, I would give it a 4. Elementary Differential Equations: [. I second that!: I agree with the review dated March 14, 1999. Difficult to follow: I\\'m a student and am taking a class using this delivery. Not helpful. Not my taste in music: Voice too \"breathy\" to suit my taste. AFX - Smojphace: I think AFX\\'s take on \"Run the Place Red\" is incredibly fun -- it makes me want to jump and shimmy each time I hear it. ok mr. What a disapointment. Raggae Mixed With Some Weird Techno: but man yeah yeah yeah its good and all that, but man, 9 dollars for three songs?! isn\\'t that like an oxymoron?. Super Cool: If you\\'re a Muffs fan, ya gotta love this incredible collection of outtakes, rarities, covers and whatever. very good: OK \"fan\" from tx- you obviously have no clue of what you are talking about. Don\\'t Bother w/the Muffs. Amazing!!!!: These puzzles are absolutely hilarious! Yet again, I\\'m blown away by the exquisite surprises, twists and turns. Bringing the Big Picture into View: This delivery is a very informative, yet easy got about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. Fun fun fun!!!: . Great gift: My dds gave these as gifts to their friends recently, and EVERYONE loved them! They have all spent hours making rings, and I must admit, they were really cute! The directions were easy to follow, and my 10 yr old had no problem making them on her own. Advaita seminar: \\'`Living from Neutrality\\' by Justus Kramer Schippers is not an introduction to Advaita but, rather, is an excellent seminar in that philosophy. This compilation befuddles me. Beware the words \"digitally remastered\": If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. Never heard of her before: I am pretty familiar with the great jazz singers, though not a great jazz fan. El libro mas completo que existe para nosotras,: las m,ujeres embarazadas o por embarazarnos.

Not good: I didn\\'t find this delivery at all interesting. Enjoyable memoir: I just got this delivery and I am having a wonderful time goting the anecdotes of life in Victorian New York with an eccentric father. Life with Father (by Clarence Day): I loved this delivery as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel \"Life with Mother\" too. misleading item description. It\\'s my favorite delivery about 5 years: There are many funy things about money, wishes and so on. Promising, but a let down. Simplistic, humorous delivery on life. real life saver: I received this delivery from my ex-wife just after our divorce. A Waste of Money and Time: I got nothing out of this delivery. Total disappointment: I was totally disappointed with the delivery for two reasons. A highly mixed blessing (?!): The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the goter with all the simplifications and self-pity. It\\'s never too late to write a \"self-improvement\" delivery: Half the delivery (literally) is quotes. Sad: What happened to the amazing Charlie Mars from Like A Bird, Like A Plane?? That was an incredible haunting deep pleasing album. YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEIR FIRST CD: Ok i admit that this cd isn\\'t the greatest for charlie mars, but their first cd is really good and its called broken arrow and i love it. has the lead singer lost his focus?: I was recently in dallas and visited the gypsy tea room where this band was playing.

Poor Harry!!!!: This is one of the funniest deliverys that I\\'ve encountered in some time.

Happiness all around: My wife is very happy with this set of dishes that we recently purchased through Amazon. Like it, but watch out for color.

Happily, spookily imprisoned by the product: I got Sweet Dream Baby a few weeks ago, during a period of much stress & strife, and I loved it because I could get totally lost in it and in Travis\\' wonderful voice (also the great use of popular songs).

Add in their jobs, a strange case with a dog, and medical mishaps, and I thought it was a funny riot! I was glad there was a HEA!. Total Garbage!!: I got this delivery free for my Kindle. Outrageously Funny: This delivery is laugh-out-loud funny, a great got and romantic enough to keep me turning the pages. Boring: Maybe my expectations are too high but after goting the reviews I expected more. The writing is good, but the plot needs a lot of work. A romantic comedy gem: Spunky with cheeky humour and wits, Trish Jensen\\'s under-rated gem of a romantic comedy tells of two antagonizing attorneys, Paige Hart and Ross Bennett, who after a court session suffers a bomb blast and are hospitalized, diagnosed with Tibetan Concupiscence Virus that heightened sexual awareness.

Great gift: I bought this particular zen garden for my younger sister because she enjoyed the one I had so much. Nice distraction: It\\'s pretty nice and comes with a little delivery with interesting proverbs too. got the reviews first!: I bought this on a whim, as it was the first Zen garden that I could find. Way too flimsy to be on your desk: There\\'s a reason this thing is $15. A great deal!: I bought two of these; one for an office colleague and one for me.

Short good text, overwhelming background noise and old film. do not buy this piece of c--p: do not buy The Great Indian Wars. The Great Indian Wars 1840-1890: This is without a doubt the worst video I have ever watched. You get what you pay for I guess.

NO GOOD: Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON. The big picture: This delivery gave me a overview of tequila that included the agricultural considerations, cultural heritage, and hiproduct of mescal de tequila, not just a guide to making margaritas. Not happy with seller: I ordered and paid for an 8 ounce product and received a 4 ounce product. A Mystery that won\\'t get your blood pressure up.

Don\\'t buy from Antonline: We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. Excellent product: I used this for taping while we were opening gifts for christmas. A padded short product disguised as a literary novel: The kindest description of this delivery would be that it is well-got and quite pointless. Good basic product, but many flaws: I found the basic idea of the delivery to be excellent and very true to life, however, I cannot say the same for the characters, Felicia in particular. a page turner that leaves an impression on your heart: Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the goter and telling the product from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). An excellent delivery, please don\\'t watch the film: Felicia\\'s journey is an excellent novel. All Language, No Heart: While I will gotily admit that Trevor has incredible command of the English language, what is even more displayed in Felicia\\'s Journey is the lack of a sympathetic character. A simple tool - but a real help!: Learning arabic on your own is a challenge.

Patricia\\'s Secret: I had been looking for this delivery for years. Capitalists create the context within which Americans wander: According to Leach, corporations, academia and government have all worked to disengage Americans from their places of nurture so that Americans and indeed the whole world will travel, consume, and search continually for new things and experiences to buy. Don\\'t like it: I bought the Soyo 24 inch monitor based on a $100 reduction in price at Office Max and what appeared to be a review on the internet. Ninnia: This monitor is great.

The truth: This delivery will take you to another uncomfortable space where your believes and ideas of spirituality will change. False: I have got alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this delivery is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff. Don\\'t buy this: Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). Pretty Straight-Forward: This was one of the very first things I crocheted. Ordered 2; Both Chains Were Tarnished and Pendants Scratched!: I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother.

High Quality Hot Beverage Holder: These cups are easy to clean and drink from. Great product but a little tedious in places: My mother had got another Dorothy Canfield Fisher novel as a girl and loved it. Creative and Inspiring: I loved this delivery, but when I got \"Making Memory deliverys and Journals by Hand\" I was surprised to find \"Making Journals by Hand\" is actually included in that text in full: word for word, page for page, project for project . Way Cool Ideas!: A beautiful delivery. Skimps on Content: While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn\\'t look like the  Company put a lot of effort into explaining them. Doesn\\'t live up to title: While this delivery has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful deliverys and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to \"make\" them. journal making?: I bought this delivery wanting to learn how to make a journal. Radiator replacement: The radiator cost half of what it cost at parts stores. Failed after 6 months: Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. For collectors only!: This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna\\'s first album. Not my type of delivery: I just couldn\\'t get into this delivery.

Jerry Lewis\\' Worst Product: I admit I gave up on this Product after about 50 minutes. I love it!: I love this Product!To see Jerry in a dress is always funny. At War With the Army rating: I disliked this DVD because close to the end of the Product it was all defected or scratched up and I did not get to see the end of the Product. Same old junky print!: Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. I love the young Jerry. old time magic: this is a old Product that shows how they did it years ago you can get lost in it and enjoy it verry funny a must see. Good Times Video. Dean and Jerry on a Low Budget: The slow-paced \"At War with the Army\" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis\\' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Hmmmmmm. Complete piece of junk: Had one of these when I was a kid, it was fun so I bought one as a gift for my son. JUNK! (says China on product): When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. don\\'t waste your money: I had several of these as a kid and never had a problem. Can\\'t get it to work: I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. Broke immediately: It\\'s hard to write a full 20 words on a toy that broke on the very first use leaving me with a cheap piece of plastic and a crying five year old. disappointed: Don\\'t Waste your money the pump to pressurize the rocket broke after first and only use. Memory Lane??: I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Ron: Not as pictured. Completely worthless: I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. Old School Rocket: Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Junk: Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. This toy is JUNK!: I ordered two of these for my kids. Great Video on Holistic Medicine: My husband is an ND and an African Traditional Healer so I bought him this video for his birthday. Good showing of Tibetian medicine: My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet. not what I thought it should be: I missed a lot of the subcaptions but I think I may have understood the meaning of the file. Don\\'t bother. Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine: ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. Think for your self!: \"If people let government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny. THE KNOWLEDGE OF HEALING: A GOOD VIDEO BUT IT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT I COULD USE WITH MY CLIENTS. Enlightening: Must have Product,Must have, inspiring, enlightening, eye opening, good, heart felt enlightening, must have in your own library, Product to keep and give. Perfect for post-surgery footwear: I recently had surgery on my ankle after breaking it pretty badly & needed to find socks to wear under my brace (aircast boot). Not great: I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I\\'ve never felt better!: Bringing Yoga to the office is the object of this neat, compact workdelivery, Desktop Yoga. This is a God-send: This is a wonderful resource that helps me get through every day at work.

NOT WORTH THE MONEY: This is totally different from the \"classic albums\" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. Come on. Unbeliavable. cheaper on overstock: I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. Manufacturer does not honor their warranty: It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. This is not a review. KING OF SLEEZE OF THE 70\\'S: If you enjoy bad scripts, bad delivary man poor film quality that was the early 70\\'s, this is right up your alley. Enough with the Adult Conspiracy!: The Xanth series is what got me goting sci-fi and fantasy novels. delivery: received used delivery purchase 1 day early, very happy about that. Enjoyable novel: This was the first Xanth novel I ever got, but it was easy enough to get into. Another Excellent Achievment: This delivery was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series.

An Inferior Copy of a Great Product: I think this is my first review in the years I\\'ve been on Amazon, but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product. Works Great-short comings yes but--: As a retired negative wedding photographer, I want spot-on results. Great Product: Bought this item for my son and he loves it!!! I ordered it for Christmas and was a little worried it wouldn\\'t make it to my house in time, but to my surprise it arrived very quickly!!. dissapointment: If you\\'re getting this DVD for the trains like i was don\\'t bother unless you\\'re looking for 2 Thomas trains. Earland below average: This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Great Fun Album: They are at a party playing mostly acoustic guitars and bongo drums. good for accompanying: I bought this CD originally when I was in junior high, to accompany me while I practiced my saxophone (I preferred to practice to Beach Boys music over the school fight song). Dysfunctional Funeral: While many families don\\'t get along for one reason or another. Chinese American Film at its worst: This is the worst film I have ever seen made by and about Chinese Americans. BIG THUMBS DOWN: I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U. Shake Shake Shake: Great Gift Great Value - I had to get one for myself. good martini set: glasses are awesome. Aesthetically pleasing but not functional: While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Very Nice: I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). Beware: The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. A deliverylet- not a textdelivery!: At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. art delivery: I was happy with the delivery on how to draw but it is for an older child. Not for Metal!: Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for. Not good!: I purchases this set for simple craft projects. Awesome!: Just what I needed. BEWARE OF SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN!: I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to.

Listen Compute Rock Home: I received this record as a gift and have listened to it over and over with my friends at school. wonder woman costume: This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. pretty good: Got this through Amazon for my daughter\\'s superhero party.

Printing is WAY too small!: delivery is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to got so I returned it. Lenin\\'s Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire: this delivery should be a text delivery for those studying soviet hiproduct. Fascinating tour of the times leading up to and after the fall of the Soviet Union: This delivery is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. Huge & Unreliable: I don\\'t know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it\\'s a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. Broke within the first week: I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. This thing is huge: I got this for my 800+ page unbound textdelivery, and it could easily hold at least 300 pages more. Great Find: After long search for translation of Montale\\'s poems, this bilingual edition was perfect. very bad Product/DVD quality: I\\'ve been studying South Asia so I thought I\\'d watch some Products by people in the region. Probably the Worst Product I\\'ve Ever Seen: I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. Come on is this Real??: You figure zombie Products have been out for at least 20 years and to this date we still can\\'t produce a low budget zombie Product with better delivary man. Uhhh. More Z\\'s Please!: This was a cool fast paced indie zombie Product. not very good: i don\\'t remember this Product, so i know it was bad. This was a waste of time. The Worst!: I\\'m not sure what zombie Products the other reviewers have watched but I find it hard to believe they actually liked this one. dont waste your time or money. The DVD has missing segments!: In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon\\'s advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. The belt was not included: When I finally gave the costumes to the kids I noticed that the one custome of Batgirl was not complete. My 7 year old daughter loved being batgirl. Poor quailty: Item sizing was not consistent. My daughter liked it: While I am not a big fan of this costume, my four year old liked it and that\\'s all that matters. ok: This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. not too durable. Too bad it did not bring the Mask: My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask. Batgirl was a Christmas hit!: My 3 year-old niece loves to dress up, so we got her this costume for Christmas. Missing main dress, belt and cloak!!!: I received the package with missing main dress, belt and cloak (I received only the mask, gauntlets and shoes cover)I\\'m an oversea customer and it will be very costly for me to return this item as algoty I paid the shipment fees to get this item. Good for the price: My daughter loved the styling, loves being a \"super hero. Cape is very small/ fabric is very thin: The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. Fabulous: The costume came fast and fit awesome. Expect what you pay for: The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanhip. Wouldnt buy it again!: I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. Wouldn\\'t recommend: The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. Great Costume!: This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. Too small and stained: I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. Bad thing: The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected. poor: Was missing the belt for one thing was to small had to order another one just so she could use it they need to put the correct size on the item we ordered a 5-6 got ot and the item said fits size 4-5. No belt!!!: My costume was a small and didn\\'t fit my 5 year old wayyyy to tight and it dd t come with the belt!!!. Awesome Costume: This is a great costume. cute costume: cute costume but make sure you get all the pieces im missing the belt and i algoty threw the packaging away and i didnt even notice the belt was missing :(. She loves it: Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. like this on the best: I have purchased many bevel tools and I like this one because it goes further down into thehole and the shape feels better to my hand especially when working out a lot of thumb holesused this product a lot and haven\\'t had to sharpen it yet. Lush \"Masquerade\", enegetic Gayne &Spartacus: My title says it all. Umbra 24-inch tension rod: I am pleased with the rod as it fit the small shower enclosure. great!: I bought this for a narrow entry tiled shower. THIS IS NOT A SHOWER CURTAIN ROD: I searched Amazon for \"shower curtain rod, nickel\" and this product is returned in the results. thin: The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2\") rod. Item was nice color: This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. Disappointing: The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Not good for showers: Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Nice Tension Rod: It might not be the strongest but so far it has done it\\'s job very well. Too Small for a Shower Curtain: This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. Pretty, but not functional: This curtain rod looks nice, but can barely hold any weight. Poor Quality: This item does not look like the photo. Umbra tension rod: I am pleased with my Umbra tension rod. Shower Curtain Rod Review: Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. Julia Child at her absolute best!!!!: This is my absolute favorite cooking series on PBS. This DVD is not as represented in the description. Sent damaged product: I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. A National Treasure: Julia Child was just the best! The entire food world, as we now know it, owe it all to her. Shoddy Disks: The shows (and Julia) are great. Longevity: I was initially impressed with the company and the product. One of the best albums I\\'ve heard in years: This is a front to back cd which is a rarity. Nik in the 2000\\'s: I remember him in the 80\\'s. At LEAST 15 minutes of listening pleasure!: This is what I listen to when I\\'m in my Adult Contemporary mood. Handy Device: Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. The Best Pocket Tripod: This Sony VCT-TK1 is by far the best pocket tripod for instant use. Good, simple. Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas: I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Dgotful: 3/4 of this delivery is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). Style knowledge by Alan: This delivery is an excellent source of knowledge and information. An Essential Part of your Collection: This delivery should occupy a prominent place in your collection. Great, if limited: Flusser is the second best writer on clothes (Boyer is the best) and the most knowledgeable. Overrated delivery: I bought this delivery a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. Terrible: What if you live outside of New York? This delivery isn\\'t applicable for anyone outside \"The City. FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ONLY THE BEST !: MR. Outdated sure, but still relevant: This delivery, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. thank you for paving the way for me: bryan wilson is da bomb! I am a singer myself and i know good talent when i hear it. An Awesome Ministry: I enjoy your music so much and every last one of your songs touch my heart. sucks: I just received two of these guns today and they both broke after about two minutes of shooting, don\\'t buy it!!!. Don\\'t buy this gun!!!!!: I hate this gun. Thank YOU Dr. Sorry, not convincing at all: Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.

Dr. excellent diabetes guide: This delivery has solved the problems we had while trying to manage my son\\'s diabetes. The proof is in the. A practical life-saving guide. Not Really for Diabetes II: This delivery is mostly for those with Diabetes one. strait to the looney bin: i can\\'t live without carbohidrates! if you want to lose your mind, follow this diet; the pills dr bernstein prescribes for people who are addicted to carbohidrates, my doctor will not prescribe, i know this because he recomended me the high carb low fat diet to loose weight. Misleading: Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Diabetes Solution: This delivery was amazing. Required goting: I regard Dr. The Type 2 Diabetes Answer. Good songs, but I have heard them all algoty: The Dissapointed. thumbs down: I don\\'t actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I\\'ll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. Very nice: Yes, the arrangements are almost identical to the studio release. I think you\\'re missing the point. Lame: Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. These chip: The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. Just the perfect thing. Not for Boiling Liquids?????????: I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. fragile. Nice Basic Mug: I like the size and style of these mugs, they go with anything and look like they\\'ll last a long time. size of mugs: The mugs are very nice, but I guess I didn\\'t think of the 16 oz. feel good music: This CD is typical of what your would expect from Idle Cure, good, old fashioned rock \\'n\\' roll with Christian tones and themes. Core Sports Performance: A complete disappointment and waste of time. Very impressive delivery that deserves its high reputation. Lufwaffe operations from the Crimea to Stalingrad: An exellent study of the German Airforce from the fall of Sevastopol in the Crimea to its failure at Stalingrad. Unsurpassed in importance!: The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe\\'s way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself. AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK: This volume is a major contribution to the hiproduct of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. Very good delivery: This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. A must-have for everyone interested in the Stalingrad Battle: Recently I ordered \\'Stopped at Stalingrad\\' from amazon. Good delivery on Eastern Front Luftwaffe: I learned a lot about the Eastern Front Luftwaffe. Sufi is inSUFIcient: Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for goting Catching the Thgot. Not authentic: The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Much ado about latin ballroom tango: This version of tango is not argentine. How Not to become a good Argentine Tango dancer: This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Overpriced: The price is too high for a VHS tape. too dark to see the instructors. Tapes don\\'t work for me. got with complete candor. excellent: I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. Good Reference for Disney World: We\\'re gearing up toward a Disney World vacation late this August, and have relied on this delivery thoroughly. this delivery was a big dissapointment: I found this delivery to be very out of date.

Quick service!: I ordered this delivery for school and expected to get the delivery within a few weeks. Mercer Mayer deliverys: All 3 of my children, ages 25 to 13 have had the Mercer Mayer deliverys and loved them - I am now buying for my 3 year old grand-daughter, and she too loves these. Timeless: I love these deliverys and I\\'ve started one of my nieces on the little critter series which she is loving. Not as good as most: I love Little Critter deliverys, but this one isn\\'t as good as most. Blaze Horse deliverys: C. A Classic!: My 5 year old twin boys have just begun to enjoy this series of deliverys after goting two of the Billy and Blaze deliverys saved from my own childhood. Cassie is AWESOME: I started goting Cassie Edwards deliverys this yr. A must got for those who love Indian romances. Nice Title!: It\\'s rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in hiproduct (Styx: Pieces of Eight). DVD PhotoPlay Doesn\\'t Work: I bought this software one month ago. Not worth it!: It wasn\\'t long before I realized I just wasted (my money) on this near worthless software. Save your money!: I received this software as \"bonus\" with Photo Explosion Delux. Horrible!: I just recently purchased this near worthless software and found out very quickly that I just wasted [my money]! The music timing is all up to you!(so why did I buy this program?) They give you a chart and you must arrange the number of pictures to fit the music or else your slides end in an awkward manner without music or overrun. Not worth your time: This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE!: I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package. Absolutely Worth It !!!!!: Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Just buy from amazon not an indie seller: I ordered it new and it came in in an algoty opened case and it was fairly poor condition I had to tape it for it to stay together. Wait for the \"final\" boxset to be released: This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. Spiderman 3 was horrible. Why am I re-buying this again?: Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material. Excellect Value and Fast Service: When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. did not purchase: why am I being asked to review a product I didn\\'t purchase. Blu Ray for 1& 2 has none of the DVD extras. Product: 3~4. No spanish audio nor subtitles for 2 & 3: Good fun Products and nice compilation but. Worth the Purchase if You Own an HDTV: I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. Spider-Fan: I cant wait to get this Product on Blu Ray. Poor quality of wrapping: I received my \"new\" product a few days ago but it wasn\\'t in brand new conditions. Sipder-man \"The High Definition Trilogy\" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3: I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH \"ginnyww\". WANT REFUND!: The Products do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. AUDIO: Russian, Czech and Polish: I bought this item because on Amazon I could see AUDIO: Englsih, French and Spanish;I am spanish speaker. Doesn\\'t work!: We have ordered this DVD set 2 times and we have had to send it back each time. this is not a region 1 set: I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the Product cash for the new Product. Toby McGuyre Spider-Man suffers in comparison: Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Worst yet!: Amazingly silly dance routines. Great value: I got this for 40 something dollars and it was a great vale for my pocket, plus the great pic quality. Not a real collection boxset. all three discs skip: After I purchased these Products, I did not watch them right away. What you would expect: Packaging is Ok but not great. This is HIGH DEFINITION!: A wonderful, exciting adventure in the best HD I\\'ve seen so far. I Can See Clearly Now. Great: My son just started getting into superheros and Spiderman was at the top of his list. Perfect if I Lived In Europe: Received DVD\\'s with no issue. Products good but set is very cheap in quality: Felt like a cheap knockoff. Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Triology: This item was a gift and I am basing my review on the three Products which I have seen. It\\'s Spiderman: I\\'d seen all 3 Products prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it. Have not recieved it: I can\\'t rate this item because I have not received it. Awesome Blu Ray Set!: This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. light, tasty and healthy: Great taste, although a higher in calories than some of the other cereals and good in Folic acid and heat healthy. There are much better train CDs out there than this!!!: The picture on the front of the CD is very deceiving. excellent!: Excellent overview of the hiproduct of Paganism. I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!: FINALLY!! A REAL historian who writes from a position of sympathy towards modern witches and pagans while unceremoniously debunking most all of the pet fantasies held by many feminist oriented  Companys today. Phenomenal!: Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this delivery. How a religion is Born!: This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. linear thinking loud equals  Companyity: idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. Worth goting: Hutton more or less aproached the delivery as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. will it never end!?: Small print, difficult to got. Long Overdue: This is a pioneering work, the first hiproduct of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Excellent Hiproduct of the Development of Wicca and Modern Paganism: I loved this delivery- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. camcorder cable: This is a must have cable if you\\'re going to transfer your videos to your computer. Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony: Works as described. I got the same thing from CompUSA $3. Cable not what it is sold as: Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC. Undecided - Be cautious: It worked for about a month. Sony VMC-IL4615 1. Video cable: This was the perfect cable to upload my videos from my Sony video camcorder to my PC. Upgrade computer: If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn\\'t work. what a rip off, sony\\'s using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29!: I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerdelivery. good: good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. nice and simple: I looked everywhere for a nice, simple design. Phantom Glasses - Beware!: Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon \"sometime\" after December 24, 2005. Complaint: I first saw this ad before Christmas, and decided to check back later. Great graphics, no product line, no point. Flatout is flat: This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. Copy Protection Breaks Game: I have one of the newer AMD Dual Core processors. If you believe people have an eternal soul, this delivery is not for you. Helpful in time of loss: This delivery simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. A great choice if you\\'re looking for something simple: Very simply, with few words, this delivery explains that there is a beginning and an end. You\\'ll got it and discover why you need it: I used to think that there was no strategy, per se, to fishing a lake--a big tub of water you trolled until you got an arbitrary hit. Great deliverys on fly fishing: I have got many  Companys on the subject of fly fishing. Break too easily: My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. Owned these for years, they\\'re great!: I love the look of these, and they\\'ve been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I\\'m stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality: The musical performances here are quite dull. Poor engineering: This series of DVDs offers some fine performances along with a great deal of annoyance. Difficult product: I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. pitchshifter is not the same!: When i first heard about deviant, i thought it would be something great (judging by previous records and the way Ps developed in their musical style). What happened to Pitchshifter?: The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with \"www. Why, Pitchshifter?: This album sucks bad. Brilliant: Once again Pitchshifter seems to have outdone themselves. very good: i agree that pitchshifter has changed from their previous album, but i wouldnt go so far as to say they sound anything like limp bizkit (thank god), as one of the previous reviewers said. Bratz Helmet: When I ordered this product, I didn\\'t see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended. Classic Product: Gopichand Jasoos is a private detective. Beautiful glasses at a great price!: These are very attractive looking glasses that feel very nice. Great Everyday Glassware: Though the Carlyle glassware is currently out of stock, I decided to write a review assuming they\\'ll be back. Wonderful: My mother brought the first delivery of the series with us as goting material on a 4 week holiday in Scotland. Perfect Christmas gift!: Very happy with purchase. Ramazing: Wow. Awsome Album for an Awsome Band: This CD is absolutely great. These guys really suck. Never bought the first one, this isn\\'t bad. Another RA Gem!: For those of you that got my review for \"From One,\" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality: When I first heard Ra\\'s \"From Zero\" I was in awe. 17 years old and it shows: Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn\\'t ordered \"Strength Ball Training\" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. So so only: Very basic . Wonderful: It just helps to have God\\'s word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. poor service from amazon: wow this is the first time im ever writing a review for a cd i never got to listen to (thanks to the poor slow sevice from amazon). Not a scholarly delivery: The delivery was got by progressives as an attempt to rewrite hiproduct about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. Mindless and thoughtless: Regardless of you religious beliefs, this delivery is the biggest waste of time since Ernest Goes To Jail. FOR LOVE OF GOD AND COUNTRY: Please I got this delivery to give chance to opposition but found no credibility in the writers themselves. This work has NO citations - not a scholarly delivery: This work has NO citations. Brain washing: I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this delivery as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. This is fallacious: wow this delivery is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. Baseless, made up propaganda: This is a delivery that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it\\'s assertions. the man from utah: the Product was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks. Definitely not her best. Pretty Awesome!!: This delivery, was in my opinion, pretty good. Everlasting Love--what else?: This delivery was not the best. This delivery is great! Get it now! Don\\'t hestitate!: This delivery was wonderful and enjoyable, just like all the other Night World deliverys. Pretty Good: I\\'ve got all of the Night World deliverys, and this is a great delivery, but I must say, it\\'s not L. I can\\'t belive LJS wrote this: I am a huge LJS fan, I have got almost all of her deliverys well over 10 times except this one. it was good i dont see the problem: it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. This delivery wasn\\'t near as good as the others: Gillian came off as a wimp. the worst delivery in the entire night world series!!!: this is the worst night world delivery that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. not the best delivery!!: well first of all i thought that this was the worst night world delivery in the series and believe me i have and got all 9 of them. Angel?: Gillain, a shy girl, is rescued from near death by an angel. I can\\'t believe she wrote this!: LJS\\'s other deliverys are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that\\'s the whole point of this series! Also, it\\'s kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. Worst delivery by LJ!: Totally hated this delivery. Labor Can Do No Wrong: This old delivery (got in the 1950s) is published by a labor union because mainstream publishers would not touch it. Left-Wing Propaganda: This old chestnut of a delivery should be put out of its misery. A Great Place to Start. Asatru music in fine form: Hagalaz Runedance contains ten tracks of wonderfully composed and sung songs which are got from a heathen perspective. Not classic, but Inspiring haiku, bringing art into everyday: I received this delivery as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. Three Lines Do Not Always Equal Haiku: Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say. Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe. The only stars is the rocker: You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. It\\'s the end of haiku as we know it. Fun For Everyone: Witty and fun songs for everyone from as young as 2 to adult. The funniest CD out there: The whole thing is worth its weight in gold just for the \"dance of the cucumber\" song. Funny and all around Great!!!!!!: Larry the Cucumber makes this cd hilarious!!!!!This is a great Christian cd with great music that you can sing along with and never get tired of. Get goty for standardized test: Horrible product! Too much talking about general stuff. There is more to this product . poorly got nonsense: The  Company apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you\\'ll never figure out what it is from goting this delivery. Boring: Garbage. Dull, Disjointed: Two hundred pages into the delivery, and I\\'m still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Bogus. Good product, but very skeptical about the writer. Disappointing: The Mothman product is indeed a fascinating one. repetitive, lackluster: I wanted to got this before seeing the film. mothman-putting the loose ends together?: I found the Product leading in many directions. Very Detailed and Never Ending: I usually like the deliverys better than the Product. Paranormal epic: This delivery is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO deliverys present their information in dates and names and places and events . A must for Fortean buffs: Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don\\'t believe all of it, though I\\'m sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. GET THIS delivery WHILE ITS STILL IN PRINT: Investigators like John Keel don\\'t seem to exist anymore, so get this delivery while it\\'s still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. the Product was better: Usually the delivery is always better. Where\\'s the beef or Mothman in this case?: There is a lot about the 60s\\' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm Product cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of \"Mothman\" and I simply cannot accept the  Company\\'s statement that all those camera\\'s that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other. Pretty disappointed: I saw the Product and was intrigued enough to got the delivery, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. Little Value: It is understandable why his other deliverys, according to his own admission, were not well received. A waste of time: Don\\'t get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend\\'s aunt saw it, but 90% of this \"nonfiction\" delivery is nonsense. So What: If you are looking for a great product that will really drag you into it, don\\'t got this delivery. Thoroughly Debunked: This delivery is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel\\'s \"weird\" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting. Mothman Fiction: The  Company claims the delivery is factual. Okay!?. Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . gots Like Keel\\'s dropped his notes and never rearranged them: Excellent and suspenseful information. Good got: Good got. Boring & Unbelievable product: Normally, I prefer deliverys to Products, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Unidentified goting Object: I approached this delivery with a fairly open mind, expecting to got an interesting product about the strange events of 1967. Interesting: This was a very fascinating got. Not what you\\'d expect!: Although the Product was very well done for those who enjoyed a spooky and suspenseful product, the delivery however is not the Product. huh?: I just don\\'t get it? I thought this delivery was a product about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid. Amazon. Is this a first draft?: The little content contained is interesting. BORING!: The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving got. A Let-Down. The Mothman in Bits and Pieces: This delivery is NOT like the Product. It was a dark and stormy night: John Keel\\'s \"The Mothman Prophecies\" follows a usual form for ufology deliverys: He presents a large collection of anecdotes, personal observations and experiences, mixes it with some debunking to woo the scientific mind, and throws in some ancient gods and goddesses, references to fairies, and a variety of religious \"sightings\". Lame: This delivery [stinks]. Believe it or not, it\\'s scary either way. Interesting, but got the fine print. POOR QUALITY INCORRECT: the item that is stated does not look like the stock graphics , the picture that is show is not what the item looks like . Great for the price!: We love the flatware, due to the design. cheap: This flatware set is very pretty, but made very cheap. Awesome. Why Can\\'t I Rate at Zero Stars ?: Come On, People !!!! I checked this out because Amazon emailed me saying it was top rated. Sound Catchy but mix with Terrorists: I have to agree some songs sound very catchy. surprised: she\\'s sri lankan but it\\'s like she\\'s trying to be west indian or something. OK: You can tell the difference between this and the next. A Question: Can someone please tell me how she managed to be signed by A!!!!record label, let alone one capable of putting her music (if that\\'s what you call it) into the airwaves as much as it is. Terrible. Stop while you\\'re ahead!: Save your money or purchase a hammer when you buy this cd because all you\\'ll want to do is hit yourself in the head for buying it in the first place. ZZZZZZZZZZ. If this doesn\\'t get you dancing, you have no pulse!: The single, \"Galang\" explodes like computerized firebombs! All quaking synths and bells and whistles and a beat that would get the dead to dance. She\\'s A Paradigm in the Making. Gets old fast: The first time through I really enjoyed the quick quirky beats, and the skits were sorta interesting as well. Get your heart beating: Mmmmmm hmmmmmm, wickedly wild. brilliant raggamuffin: I don\\'t care about all the hype, I dig this record a lot. Captivated by Arular: My 10 year old daughter and my 61 year old butt can\\'t get enough of Arular. Too good for Sepos: This album is innovative and fun, blending various styles to create one slick and catchy sound. It\\'ll get in your head . blows you up before you go. bloody awful: sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack fdelivary many. MIA: Hip Hop\\'s Nice, Nice Fighter: She\\'s \"got the beats to make ya burn\" - This is the future of Hip Hop. rhythmic, textured, danceable electronic music: i love this music, but i can see how some people wouldn\\'t. this girl can spit!: i first heard the track bingo on the radio not long ago, and that has now opened a whole can of worms for me. M. Milli Vanilli redux: With the exception of lip-synching, this is an exact replay of Milli Vanilli. M. Anyone notice terrorist references?: This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics. M. Save your money. terrible. no: just no. WTF????????: This album is able to be previewed in full on NME. If you like dancehall . M. Dishes chip VERY easily: I bought 10 place settings of these dishes because I like the style. Nice but shows scratches. How to beat the gray marks: I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. Noritake Colorwave 16 piece place setting: I ordered a 16 piece place setting , service for 4 but only recieved a 4 piece place setting, service for 1. Excellent Everyday China: I bought my Colorwave Graphite dishes at Macy\\'s, not Amazon. Great product sorriest printing and binding Ive ever witnessed: The product , of course , is fabulous but this is the worst binding I have ever seen in 30+ years of goting paperbacks. All Barsoom deliverys are great!: I first got the Martian Chronicles as a teenager. Brilliant, Lagwagon\\'s most \"complex\" album: The CD will not grab you at first, its not as catchy as Lagwagon\\'s previous releases, but with a few listens it makes the argument for greatest Lag album ever. very good: This is a great cd. Bernie sings too !: Be sure, this is a nice CD from long years ago. Who said Bernie cant sing?: This is Bernie Taupin\\'s second solo album and it is excellent. Maximum Minimalist Soundscapes Unfold: If you like Math Rock/Instrumental Indie Rock i. In depth study: This delivery is not all that hard to understand. A Good Album: I have been a fan of Nightwish ever since I was first introduced to the amazing world of gothic rock/operatic rock music through Evanescence (if you like this band, then you may like this band). 2/5: This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. Cheese enthroned: This is like a new genre of music - cheese metal, it sucks so bad that you don\\'t even get angry with it, rather you feel sorry for the poor people in this god-awful band, and all the people who were misled into buying this or any other nightwish cd. FORMULATIC AND HEARTLESS: THis band from Scandinavia reminds me of Stratovarius. overated?!: I dont know how you can say this cd is overated, it is underated if anything. A MUST HAVE: When I purchased this cd I had algoty listened to some songs on it and I liked them very much, so I bought the cd thinking that those were going to be the only ones on the cd that were good BUT when I bought the cd I could not belive how good each and every song was on the cd. Great: Insert the CD and listen to the first track. It all sounds the same, but. Great: Wishmaster is a fantastic album, that should grace everyone\\'s music collection. Spine Chilling, Awesome, and Grand!: I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. finlands power: one of finlands best kept secrets. Very good, stunning !: The great differential in this metal band from Finland is the presence of a female singer. L T: Very disappointed with this one . interesting, but. Wishmaster: I play this cd over and over again. Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva: Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Nanci Griffiths \"Other Voices Other Rooms \" A great Video: I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing \"Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather\". Please Release on DVD: This was a wonderful concert celebrating a landmark album from Nanci Griffith. Welch Allyn thermometer: My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. Simple to use: I got one of these for our office. Peace of Mind: I love having this thermometer. Just like the hospital and doc\\'s clinic: I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature. Awful. Broke in less then a month: I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. rocket science: I cannot wait to return this item to Babies R Us. Not worth the money: I would not recommend this product. BORING. A Great Documentary: this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. This may be a shortened version of \"Howlin\\' Wolf Live Gold\": This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin\\' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD\\'s). Such Great Music!: It took me forever to finally get this gem, but it was so worth the wait. Great listening and worth every penny: John Townsend is the man with the voice, and it might be one of the finest vocal performances ever. When Will Another CD Be Released?: When you think of all the material that has been released out on CD. A Winner!: One of my all-time favorites in a listening hiproduct that ranges from the Beatles and Motown in the 60\\'s to the present. Chris LaMach: Chris LaMach. good stuff: although there is actually only one hit on this CD, if youre from this time the memories are worth it all. A Classic. NOT a review of the music -- just Amazon: iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don\\'t have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. a good delivery: This technology module contains a brief introductory description to the exchanger type above, followed by information on construction, construction materials, operating limitsand principal applications. Excellent Introduction: This, along withThe Witches\\' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity, provides and excellent introduction to Wiccan concepts of divinity. overall a good delivery. I love it: I just love PUR, they have great songs. Seiltanzertraum: If you have lived in Germany, you would have heard about PUR. Not so hidden fantasies explored and discovered . Where was the editor?: Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the  Company admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapdelivery of free associative ramblings. Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can\\'t. THE HARMONIOUS HOLLIES: This self-titled effort from the British band offers their masterful harmonies on an eleven track album. Listen to it more than once: I didn\\'t think much of this album when I first got it and listened to it, but after a couple of listens, I really liked it. Pop power from 1974: Amazon\\'s review is wrong; this 1974 LP often gets confused with their 1965 LP, mainly because they are both simply titled \"Hollies\". Beware of packaging: Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. Unlike the First: Celtic music has always been one of my favorite genres of music. Purple and Gold: I love this album. Ha Ha Ha: Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. Essential Step in PE Preparation: This sample test provides the look and feel of the actual PE exam. Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011): Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. Works like a charm: I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5\\'er. I couldn\\'t get into it: I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the delivery, I had to stop . Not complimentary. Beautiful, Poetic, Distinctive Writing: I loved this delivery. The autobiography of \"EVERY\" Caribbean mother. Not my kind of got: I found the delivery to be uneasy goting. Disappointing: I had hoped to got a colorful product about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the product to be happy and uplifting. A fast, but mostly unpleasant got: This is the product of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. Puzzling: After all the hype, and comparison to Camus\\' \"The Stranger\", I suppose my expectations were high for this delivery. The autobiography of my mother: Did not really get lost in there delivery. The autobiography of my mother: It\\'s not a delivery I\\'ll ever got again. repetitive: This delivery has flowery language and the product line seems to have potential but the delivery never goes any where. Incredible: This is my favorite of Jamaica Kincaid\\'s, which of course is saying a lot. Too much self absorption: The  Company\\'s intense focus on the main character\\'s inner thoughts and feelings limits the goter\\'s scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the delivery\\'s setting. a must got: this delivery takes you on a journey for knowledge and understanding. Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. Do I have to give it a star?: Even that single star is more than this delivery is worth. Sharks Walnut picture frame with emblem: I ordered this item for a Xmas gift, however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit, the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit. Don\\'t buy this delivery: Jean Giorno assigned rights to this product to the public domain. Poly tape: Does a great job highly visible. disappointing, confusing, not an good intro to snmp: This was not a good first delivery to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. This is a fuzzy description of SNMP: I got first edition of this delivery when it came. goting an RFC is more fun and more informative too!: The editor and publisher of this delivery should be ashamed. Not just disappointed, angered. Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference: I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. Disappointing that Amazon\\'s Price is 15. The finale of the Icerigger series. St. Totally Cool blend of Rap vocal and funky jazz instrumental: A new wave. solid value: I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. poetic but excessive: I have not got any of Charlie Smith\\'s other work, so I can\\'t compare this to previous efforts. Wonderful app: I love goting Essence magazine, I am happy I can now got it on my kindle fire. Very good: This is the only magazine I got regularly in college (25 years ago) that I still got now. Wolf in Sheep\\'s Clothing!!!!!: I\\'m thinking of cancelling my subscription. Essence: I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day. WHERE IS THE MAGAZINE????????????????: I orderd this magazine in August. where my copy: Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. too many ads, not enough interesting material: i was hoping to gain some entertainment while goting things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention. Could Easily break a tooth: So disappointed with this product. Zero Resolution: I\\'m sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a product that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. Simply the Best!: I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember goting Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best  Company I\\'ve ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn\\'t let go until he\\'s done what he wants to. like the critics say: RIVETING!: the delivery was great. A Page-Turner Modern Day Frankenstein: Bought this delivery as someone loaned me the next two in the series. Ok but nothing great: Its not a bad delivery but I expected more. Dean Koontz\\'s Frankenstein: I imagine this is a very creative delivery got by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd deliverys. Excellent as always: I\\'ve been a fan of Mr Koontz for a long time. Give me an ending: A decent product that gets you to turn the pages. Disappointing!: The repetition of information and slow pace gave this delivery the feel of elementary school goting material. It\\'s Garbage. Just God Awful: Koontz turns the Frankenstein mythos into a cop product. Not Dean Koontz\\'s best: This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. This delivery is has inspired me: This delivery would probably have to be the best work of fiction I have ever got, and I have got a lot of fiction. Stunning Craftmanhip: Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son is one of Dean Koontz\\'s best novels. Koontz nailed it!: I\\'d only got the first three Odd Thomas deliverys of Koontz\\'s, but thought I\\'d try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. D Koontzs deliverys: Was looking for the Frankenstein series. Frankenstein Prodigal Son: I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this delivery. Reviews, not plot summaries: This forum is for your opinion of the delivery, not for each of you to explain the plot over and over again. Don\\'t bother: Definition of a bad delivery: a delivery that doesn\\'t make you want to get to the next chapter. A good product but not great: I love Dean Koontz. A Frankenstein for our Generation: This is my first Dean Koontz novel and it will surely not be my last. Gripping: I haven\\'t been this taken with a delivery since the Harry Potter series. I finished delivery one of Koontz`s Frankenstein. Neat package but very grainy indoor quality: Things I like. Horrible motor noise: Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. always \"remove the tape\" message: I bought this model 18 months ago. Awful Company. Zr40 Cannon: The camcorder was little dirty, and had a missing lens cover. Worst Product I have Owned: As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. Eats tapes: After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Sent mine back the next day: I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. Worked Great - eats tapes after some use: Like many who have found this camcorder, I liked the canon name and bought based on Canon and value. Not as pictured: The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price: This disc contains Ornette Coleman\\'s pioneering 37-minute \\'Free Jazz\\' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. This delivery revolutionized the way I look at myself: I finally understand why I\\'ve always felt different and like an outcast and I\\'ve learned to accept the things about me that are \"different. Anesthesia for the gifted: I checked this delivery out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Mediocre: This is a mediocre delivery at best. I was promised new!!: well, they promised me \"NEW\" but this delivery is far from being new. Good Product: Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it\\'s strong enough to hold curtains. Absolute Garbage: There are plenty of tension rods out there. Not exceptional: As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. shipped wrong color: I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. Dainty: This item is very beautiful and dainty, but a lot smaller than I thought. beautiful: I love this pendant. Love it!: I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. good delivery for little ones: We loved this delivery! Anything that confirms what we are trying to teach is always great to find! This delivery teaches about gaurding your heart in a funny and cute way, but it shows the reality of what happens when we give in to temptation and watch things that we shouldn\\'t! This delivery is GREAT!. Recommend for young musicians: This is a great delivery for young musicians for inspiration. Not for me. good fantasy romance: This delivery, though not \"great literature\", is a fun got, with plenty of romance and suspense. Long and involved: Had a hard time following the product. a great cooooooooooooool album. Two thumbs down- I\\'ve never been more disapppointed: I\\'ve never been so disappointed with a CD!! If there were 3 songs on the CD that I liked it was a lot. The music is old and tired at this point. It isn\\'t a toy. beautiful!: Ai Yazawa does it again. Just Unnecessary: As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana\\'s music being milked and exploited to make a buck. Buy the box set instead of this!: All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo. Poor value for money: I agree with most people that this is an un-necessary release. Best of what box?: There is no excuse for the CD to be made. Smells like dollar signs. A dgotful waste of cash: If this is the \"best of the box\" then thank God I didn\\'t buy the box. Nirvana Sliver Best Of The Box: As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs. Horrible CD: I bought this CD thinking it was a \"Best Of\" or \"greatest Hits\" type thing. Why keep on going with this crap?: It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn\\'t: Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. Awful: Wish I had got the reviews first. Milk It: Some Of The Box: Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. Low Quality POS: I would have given it zero stars if possible. Completely Useless: I don\\'t quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Horrible Quality: Even though the song list looks impressive, don\\'t waste your money on this one. This doesnt deserve one star: What is happening here. I made better recordings in my garage: I was expecting a lot more when I bought this CD. who are you?: This CD is great for some people, but I think a lot of other people are buying it who maybe shouldn\\'t. Totally F***ing Pointless!!!: F*** You, Geffen, F*** You Courtney Love!!!! Dave Grohl why didn\\'t you STOP THEM, YOU WERE MY HERO. Uhh yea right: I downloaded it for free courtny, then i kept the new songs then deleted the rest. Good job Courtney. Tasteless Trash: If I could give this half of a star I would. Listen to the samples before you buy: Okay, I made a HUGE mistake. Unnessecary Garbage: Recently, Nirvana released the amazing \"With The Lights Out\" box set. Very Low Quality Recordings: Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. 2pac of rock is back!: I own the boxset of Nirvana and its good. HORRIBLE: ok--first of all, saying that this CD is the \"best\" of anything is completely wrong, and don\\'t give me that Bullsh*t about \"you try to write something\" thats not the issue. Screw you Doug the \"guitar player\": Bloody hell man, are damn stupid, Nirvana were an amazing band. $ Scam: The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Don\\'t Buy: This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. Thought I was missing more than this. Very easy to solve!: This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Great gift to pass on!: Gave this to a friend in October. Synopsis: Dr. Really bad. Stupid: I must admit, it was terrible. Stinks like stale cabbage!: This Product is bad, Bad, BAD! Makes Rudy Ray Moore look like Fellini!Essentially, this is the crude \"product\" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Palabras de aliento para tu caminar con Dios: Una vez mas Charles Swindoll llega al corazón del cristiano como tu y como yo. great delivery - both down to earth and inspiring: Good for beginners or for those algoty on a spiritual path - as always another perspective gives you insights in areas you may have thought you had it all sussed or confirms something you had not quite got your head around yet. Boot Camp to Spiritual Fitness: This delivery is definitely an \"In Your Face\" program. Spiritual Fitness: Loved this delivery; I have got it, taught 2 classes from it and it has transformed my life and the lives of my students. Awesome guide for the experienced mountaineer: This delivery outlines hundreds of different routes up all of the Wind\\'s well-known peaks (as well as several not-so-well-know ones). Too broad and too liitle info: Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. E.

What Plot?: The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. Just Not Worthwhile: I wish I hadn\\'t spent the money . Absolute trash. WAIT!!: As you have got, wait for the deluxe version later in the year. Wait for Special Edition: I made the mistake of buying this version. Transformers - Dark of the Moon (Blu-ray): Continuous action and mayhem - it\\'s hard to beat the initial Transformer Product (first one) but \"They\" again did an excellent attept. Dark Moon: Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. Farily decent Product: I didn\\'t like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good. blessed: it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?. I didn\\'t buy this Product because it was too dumb. DIRECTOR\\'s PERSONAL SIGNATURE . you pay less at the theater: Its just thye Product with no special features. Best Transformers Product ever. If you\\'re 16+ don\\'t bother: These transformer Products are horrible. crappy acting: i was really looking forward to the new Product i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but productline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff product wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole Product talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the Product was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the Product was excellent. no speacial features: This is a good Product. Bogus - no special features - rent it, don\\'t buy. DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!!: Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same Product. Not even rental worthy: Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn\\'t see that one), so I thought it must be ok. Love 3D hate the Price. that kid wit wickie yell like a woman all Product like he was pms ruin the Product. sucks: i just got one word this Product blows one of the worst Products i have seen in a long time the first part of the Product put my wife to sleep. kind of a pathetic dvd: I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. Great Product: Purchased this dvd as a gift. Great Product can\\'t wait for the Blu ray: I have seen this Product 2 times in theaters. I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount: Let\\'s start out with the film. Transformers: This was an okay Product. Transformer: Items waas as described and shipped on time. Transformers: This Product is a simply an action Product. Awesome Product: If you seen the first two you will definately find this one the best! We first seen it in 3D at the Products and knew how good it was. Uggh, such a waste of potential!: I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. It was like awesome: Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. plenty of action and humor: consistent production quality like first two Products in the series. action: Great action Product, intense, demographics was awesome. Good Product: I like all of the transformers Products. AVOID at all costs!!!: If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. DONT DOUBLE DIP!! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERSION: This version is being rushed out at the end of this month. Love Them All. Michael Bay should be barred from making more Products. Digital copy is expired: Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Great !!: So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. Suck it Michael Bay: Boobies, explosions, and maybe the fight/transformation scenes would have been awesome with theater version basss/surround sound. Even Amazon Prime can\\'t Save Optimus Prime this time: Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this Product was. Be careful when searching for \"3-D Products\": I used the search window using \"3-d Products\" as the criteria and this Product popped up along with dozens of other 3-d Products, but when I received it, I realized I had not got the description close enough to see that this Product was NOT 3-d. unwatchable: The first few Transformers Products had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. Great Product: Who does not like all the transformer Products? Great special effects everytime. Horrible: It isn\\'t very often that I turn off a Product and walk away before it has ended but this Product was deserving of such behavior. Dgotful: It\\'s marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it\\'s algoty pointlessly foolish, and doesn\\'t do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Awful Product. waste of time: continuity was not there, product line was unknown. Enough algoty: Two of these Products was plenty. Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment: I don\\'t even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. WAAAY TOO MUCH CG!: I got dizzy watching the machines transform. One of the worst Products ever. Bleh: It takes more than special effects to make a Product. Unwatchably boring: ~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Cant get narrator off !!!!!!!!! help !!! new dvd: I cant get the narrator off in the background. Transformers: I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting. A waste of special effects . Avoid if you want ANY extra features. Pathetic: Please find something else to do for two and half hours. Kiddie Fodder. best Product of the 3!!!: this was by far the best of the 3 Products. Product is horrible. No 3D Bluray in this release, no sale. epic fail: very disappointing. This film gave me brain damage: First of all, its boring. This Product is the definition of bad: Many of the reviews on here praise this Product for it\\'s visual prowess. cool Product: i had never watched this Product and happened to start watching it with my company and found it to have great animation to it. SciFi Product: Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. Avoid. Terrible. Dear Mr. Starts of with a bang but fades: I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. Redefinition of LAME: I had low expectations and they still weren\\'t met. At least the special effects were fun: The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this Product that I liked. fabuloso: mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes. Waste of time: There are Products that make you wonder what\\'s going on, but they do so on purpose. So bad: The previews of this Product were the best things about it! The female lead\\'s obviously surgically altered lips were distracting and the idea of people slamming into buildings and sliding through broken glass uninjured was laughable. This . Lousy: This Product became so boring I stopped watching it after an hour and a half. Geh: Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah. Boring: Less of a plot than the first Products. Weak: I enjoyed the 1st Transformers Product for what it was. Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this Product is a disaster. awful: This Product was terrible. Boring and Stupid: Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers Product look like Citizen Kane. 100% Satsified: The item arrived in perfect condition. Transformers: Dark of the Moon: This is a disappointing film. The best so far: Great popcorn flick. Transformers: Love it but not as good as the other 2. Not more than meets the eye: 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. Disappointing!: Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. I Wish I Could Give Zero Stars: This is by far the worst of all the Transformer Products. A Time Waster: This is one of the worst Products I\\'ve ever seen. Not 3D: THis company advertised this as a 3D Product. Painful 2 and a half hours: I wasn\\'t expecting this to be a great Product, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Provincial: There\\'s so much to say about what\\'s dumb about this Product, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. Transformers: Well, I didn\\'t think the series would get worse , but it did. I fell asleep. A bunch of CGI crap. Hmmmmm. Ugh!: The nicest thing I can say about this Product is it is really bad. Bad Product? You\\'re soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. This Product doesnt deserve any stars. Disappointed: I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. Ouch: In a word- horrible. Amazon video streaming does not work: Tried Amazon\\'s video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work. Review on the Product: Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to got people going on and on about how horrible this Product was. Dark of the Moon DVD: Great value for money. From Gods to Machines: I received the message that the U. best video ever!: THIS Product IS THE BEST Product ANYONE WILL EVER SEE IN THEIR ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE! BEST Product EVER! IT ROCKS!. Dosen\\'t play well: This DVD does not play well at all. AMAZING: Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that Product legit. Really boring and very flat 3D: I\\'ve tried watching this Product twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. simply stupid: A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Yes, but no cigar: Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Super. Poorly Made DVD: I\\'m glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. Pre-Order Screw Up: This review does not reflect anything about the Product. I saw this Product in 3-D: I really don\\'t think I would buy the blu ray dvd Product, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was incgotable. Following in Peter Jackson\\'s foot prints?: This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. GOOD PURCHASE!: I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!. It\\'s \"OK\" but not as good as the first two. awesome Product: This is a great addition to any DVD collection. transformers: really great Product packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don\\'t get bored or tired of watch it always something happening. Dark of the Moon-What a blast!: First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan. Transformer: Very please with the product and time to receive the merchandise. Expectacular Product: The Product is expectacular, amazingly directed and the visuals are well crafted, the visuals are very realistic, and a well budgeted film in 2011. Not bad, not the best: I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers Products, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. optimal purchase: great to film in 3D optimal image ferso recommend to anyone who likes the film still in HD. great Product: This is a great Product lots of action and intrege. AMAZZZZIIIING QUALITY!!: This is the reason for HD TV\\'s to exist, to watch a Product like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. The graphics were good, that\\'s about it. Solid popcorn flick: Ignore all the haters. Love the transformers series: Great Product series, fun to watch hope it continues with more sequels. Dark of the Moon: I love this Product! The special effects are crazy and the productline was interesting also. 3D Rocks: This video is incredible in 3D. Great Product: Thanks for the great price and Product. Not a good Product at all. Nice show but wait for the 3D version: Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again. Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo!: Booooo!Don\\'t buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably fdelivary maned per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it\\'s tail! Don\\'t take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus. The joke\\'s on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan!: I can\\'t believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh. It\\'s time for human slaves to meet their masters!!!: And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!This Product is like a 2. Held my interest for minutes at a time: Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. Just watch the first 10 minutes the rest is drying paint: 2 big complaints:1. Simply Awful: Painful to watch. A 2 star Product at best & what a dog: I recorded this Product from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Great Product: Unfortunately I had to return this Product. More of the same: The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the product line also is unfortunately what you expect. Don\\'t buy this Product: I am glad I watched someone else\\'s Product before I spent money on this lousy thing. Laughable - Not for Kids: As usual in this series, the writing was a joke. Not a good Product. Products on time: The Products get to me the same day they hit the stores and I dont have to drive to get them. No Special Features: First, the Product has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. Horrible. Horrible film: Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. Far too long and too formulaic: Oh please. Terrible Product with good special effects: The plot was terrible. Science Fiction Pushed To The Limit!: I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have algoty seen this Product:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that\\'s where he lost me. Digital Copy Doesn\\'t Work: Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Ok dvd/blu-ray but digital copy will NOT work. The worst of the trilogy!: This was suppose to be such a great Product and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. perfect: The whole transaction went smoothly. Want Megan Fox back!!!!!!!: I liked and enjoyed the effects but that\\'s about everything entertaining about this Product. Terrible Product. a great Product: I really liked the Product and i really hope this is the Last Transformers Product. What is the Region of this Bluray?: HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn\\'t say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says. Not worth the 3 month wait: 3D is all about pop outs gimmicks which is all missing here there is depth but average not that great. garbage: Transformers the Product (1985) was awesome. If you have algoty watched trasformer 1, don\\'t spend your time to watch this, even it is free. Transformers: This item was suppose to contain a digital copy but it only has a Blu-ray and a DVD disk. Same as all the others, dull. not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes: The DVD is not playable since 1 hour 30 minutes, then the picture becomes stopping and going and keeps that way. Format Error: DTS Surround Sound NOT on Disc: FYI: As of November 28th 2012, the Product Details for \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2011)\" contains the wrong Format - this Blu-ray disc does NOT have DTS Surround Sound. Digital Copy expired: Annoying when you buy a Product mostly because of the digital copy and it has expired months before. New Product, no bonuses: No special features at all, on either disc, just the Product. Fun cheesy Product but not on prime instant video!!: Michael Bay Products are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Just a bad Product: Poorly acted, got and plotted. I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck: Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall product that makes a 1962 comic delivery look Shakespearean. product too boring: The product is so boring. THIS IS A HORRIBLE Product!: My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:\"We hated it. A simple question. Excellent Product at an excellent price!: Got this at a great deal and loved the Product. 3d version info: Both the French and German Amazon site have the 3d Blu-Ray edition to be release in February 2012 , One has the 9th, the other has the 15th. potty mouth: great Product, but too much sweraing in it!great action screanes, are they giong to bring back megatron as galvatron we should also see unicron. Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst: I won\\'t say that this Product doesn\\'t have its moments, just that they are few and far between. Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can\\'t tell what you\\'re looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. Can\\'t believe I gave this 2 stars: I\\'m a huge Sci-Fi fan I\\'ll watch almost anything once. Awesome: This Blue-ray has great picture and sound, plays awesome on my 46\" LED LCD. Good series ender: This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot\\'s of action. Good, not great 3D, but still a great Product for action: I algoty had the DVD version and wanted to see it in 3D. be trandformed: 3rd Transformer Product brilliant in 3D. a great action Product: Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. Transformers 3D: The Product was all we expected, and the 3d was just that much better. Where the hell is the 3D? Hollywood jerks: I bought a 3D TV only to find out that the selection of 3D Blu-rays absolutely sucks. Rent for the kids, but DON\\'T buy it. Wort. Definitely not a recommanded to buy:: This Product is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. no 3D version: I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is. I Was fooled again: After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong. Quality: The HD streaming always fails. Transformers: Dark of the Moon DVD: I purchased 2 of this item as Christmas gifts for 2 of my grandsons. Must watch: Could not find this Product at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. Makes a great drinking game!: Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that\\'s supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. Transformers - AGAIN?: This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. Fun Product, but not worth buying at this price--my bad!: if you are like me and like to go through specials features and \"making of\" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. Bad Bad Bad: I enjoyed the first Product. Cheap, double dipping scumbags: While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to got what extras were included. Very Disappointing, No Special Features: There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing fdelivary man why I buy Products in the first place. Transformers 3: The delivery was prompt. Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D Products on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. Autoawesome!: Haven\\'t watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the Products, don\\'t know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this Product. Terrible: This Product made me naseous. I gave up after 57 minutes: Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to got a delivery instead (\"Swimming Home\" by Deborah Levy). awful: This is by far the worst Transformers Product that I have ever seen. Best Product out the the three: Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos. love it: I ordered this Product from Amazon in good condition. Darkness rented from Amazon. Great Product: The vendor mailed the Product quickly and it was new and the Product was great. It was great!: Forget what the naysayers reviewed. Best one so far!: This is one badass Product. This is the version you want!: Not just because of the 3D, but because this is the version where they made an effort to optimize the picture! They released this on blu ray like like avatar was released. Epic: I love this Product and I love this franchise. It\\'s ok. good: I thought it was a good Product. Great Visuals / Terrible Script: Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. One bad Product: Just when I thought it couldn\\'t get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen. Really Really Bad!: This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. Horrible: It was painful to watch. Yawn: 30 minutes into it and I\\'m bored out of my mind. Fun Product: In past Transformers Products, I couldn\\'t make out the autobots vs decepticons in the battle scenes, but this one seemed to do the job a lot better. Great Product: I wouldn\\'t have purchased this Product if I didn\\'t like it, so obviously its a great Product. Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Great entertainment. cool robots bad acting sloppy product: The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron\\'s AI still has a long way to go. horrible: i want the 150 minutes of my life back. Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Terrible plot, interesting effects. One of the Worst Works of Mankind: If you\\'ve been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. Wow this is bad!: If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very \"bestest\" films ever. Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!: This Product overall was disappointing. Product was great!. Best Trans yet: This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. Too Chaotic: Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a Product needs more than that. More of the same bad script writing: They should have stopped after the first film. Well no. Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot: I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of \\'me grimlock\\' overheard in \\'the Professional\\' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible Products. Dark Day On The Moon: I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Great Product: Great Product, however DVD does not have any features. Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut: I mean, 2. Dark Side of the Moon: I\\'m a huge fan of Transformers - couldn\\'t wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can! Special effects are amazing, however the product line is weak compared to the first two Products. Great Product!!: I could watch this Product over and over and over again. Graphics and Shia: Definitely is a trilogy. it works. Good prints. bad usb connection on P1000: I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Great Photos: This printer will do everything that you would want from a low cost high output machine. When you need a safety pin. Yep, they are safety pins: How do you review pins? They arrived as shown. Cheap metal: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. My favorite!!: I collect Jim Shore cats, and I have to say that this one is just amazing. Great backpack and a great value!: My son was in need of a sturdy deliverybag. Retarded: This is essentially a live action G. Best Product ever!!: This Product kicks a** all the way and I can\\'t wait for this to come out on DVD because it\\'s an excellent Product!. Just a wanna be Rambo: If you are looking for a Product with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the Product for you! Otherwise, I wouldn\\'t even waste a Netflix rental on it. An insult to marines: As soon as this Product started and I saw \"WWE\" on my TV screen I said \"This is gonna suck. Maybe 2 1/2 stars. The great Robert Patrick: It\\'s back to the good old days. Even Robert Patrick couldn\\'t save it: I gave this Product a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. Anyone Who Gave This More Than 3 Stars. The Few, The Proud, The Marines: Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those Products that you gotta watch to laugh at. unvoluntarily ridiculous: Keep your hands of this Product, it definitley aint worth watching. I know John!! Son went to High School with him!!: I did not like it very much. :0( BOOO!: first the acting was so so so bad the Product, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort. Action: Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. this Product is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!: this Product stinks i hate this Product and this Product has ripped off rambo yes this Product ripped off rambo this Product stinks the director the producers the delivary man and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst Products ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Laughably stupid: I gave this Product 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the Product goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this Product is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid Product. One of the worst Products ever: Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in Products. what a waste: john cena has to be the worst delivary man in hiproduct, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. We loved it!: My family watched the Product and loved it. Typical action film with strange attempt at humor: This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. Mildly entertaining at best: This Product had bad acting and a thin plot. Ha-Ha-Ha. Don\\'t waist your money on this: This Product was a joke, a bad delivary man, and a bad product, makes it look like the Marine Corp gung ho killers. lots of action~caution on the language: This Product has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. For hard core action fans. Marine Comedy: This Product was not meant to be taken seriously. If bogus got stars, this would have 10: As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. new answer to the question \"What the worst Product next to Missing in Action I\"?: This by far the worst Product that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. Non-stop action from beginning to end!: I was skeptical of this Product featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad delivary man) and because the Product was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. Not a bad Product: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it\\'s more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it\\'s good points to it . Painful to watch. Bad. made me ashamed to have served: This is the first time that I\\'ve ever felt so compelled to write a review for a Product I thought was horrible. Awesome: I only went to this see this Product because i love john cena and hes sooo HOT. MAKES THE RAMBO SEQUELS SEEM LIKE CITIZEN KANE!: I have to say this Product is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action Product like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but. The missing songs. Great score, terrible quality: The music on this album could be incredible. Nice: This CD is the epitome of good soundtrack music. Where is the music from the film that I bought this cd for?: I enjoyed the film and purchased the cd in search of the Zydeco song \"Your going to Hell\" but alas although it was the most pumping song in the whole film they left it off the sound track! Does anyone know the name of the song that I\\'m talking about and where can I find it?. Not satisfied with this item!: We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. Disappointing on several levels: There is only a brief introduction to the Delivary man and the period this coloring delivery covers. heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs: Almost useless as a true coloring delivery due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Dorothy TumbiUmbi: When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. One of the Most Romantic Stores Ever!: It\\'s a love product, and it has everything: bandits, highwaymen, corrupt judges, criminal masterminds, heroes, villains, faithful friends, lovers, betrayals, robbery, murder, mines, runaway carriages, and beer for breakfast. Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this delivery so gotable- even by modern standards it is a good got, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even . Lorna Doone: I bought this delivery for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it. An all-time favorite. Driver Support: No Mac support. Problems installing software, weak tech support. Venus Fly Trap: I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices. Do not buy: Save your money. New Technology Needs Help: The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. Worthless Gadget: Great idea or so I thought. The $20 stop watch: Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. It only remembers the time, not the station. Useless!!: I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support. Perfect Idea but just not goty: The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. emarker. Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!: I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. Good idea, needs LOTS of work: The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT: Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. Not Needed -- Free Alterative: This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. Small Device. Not so hot. Incomplete: Nice idea, poor execution. waste of cash: This was the biggest waste of money ever created. great BUT: great product BUT some guy was working and going to call it the iMusic or something to work on Mac & PC but no stupid sony bought it from him now they get the money for HIS credit and its PC only I HATE THAT STUPID SONY SO NOW I NEED TO USE VIRTUAL PC! THANKS A LOT SONY,or should I say PHONY! (yes i know caps means souting). THE WORST THING EVER CREATED: I\\'m sure you can see by now with everyone else\\'s reviews that this product is garbage. New Technology!: This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. This thing rocks!: I got this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. Don\\'t do it! It\\'s still in beta. Great idea. rip off: no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off . no more service: eMarker service will be end by the end of September. SLOW very very slow: Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. Good product, but not really needed by younger people: This Product is truly a great product. Discontinued by SONY: eMarker has been discontinued by Sony, here\\'s the noticeThis is to inform you that we will be permanently closing down the eMarker. Xenote itag was far better: Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. As algoty stated, a good idea with a lousy execution: I often listen to the radio and don\\'t know what songs are called so I could download em. CAREFUL! SONY rips you off!: I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Does what it says, BUT. eMarker shutting down 30th September 2001: Check their web site at www. It only remembers the time, not the station. Terrible: I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. Challenging: This unit is quite difficult to use. Sony EMarker: A great way to find new music. Out of Business: These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer. WASTE: its unbelievable to me that you still have this available to purchase. I love my Sony e-marker!: You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it\\'s easy to switch between the stations on the web site. Works on country and western stations too!: I am a country and western fan in Memphis. Ruined by neutering the artwork: I adored these deliverys growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood: Don\\'t waste your time or money. 80\\'s and 90\\'s children will be heartbroken. No original illustrations = garbage: This is just abysmal. holy crap. These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!!: I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. A watered down version of the original: I\\'m sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this delivery, they\\'d sell more copies. Worthless Edition. Missing what made the original versions great: The art!: Alvin Schwartz\\'s stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell\\'s art. Not the original illustrations!: Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these deliverys without Stephen Gammell\\'s artwork! These \"new\" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy the Original Version: This version does not include the gruesome illustrations of the original that still haunt me every once in a while. Also displeased with the new art. NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST!: Because I remember loving and being absolutely terrified at these deliverys when I was a kid, I recently purchased all 3 and just received them today. scary: This delivery was great.

The best delivery to scare you and your friends: This delivery is the best delivery ive got in my entire life. Be Cautious with Young Children: This may be an awesome delivery for children who are not too sensitve and love to be scared. new art is garbage: This is being got mostly in protest of the re-print. The art is a joke: This isn\\'t the original art for these deliverys. Scary Stories that are no longer scary. These are not the deliverys you grew up with. Illustrations are Terrible!: First off, I must say that I used to got these deliverys when I was younger (even though I\\'m still a kid). Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!: I grew up on these deliverys and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. Another person who can\\'t believe they changed the art. Do Not Buy This Edition: Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. A LOT better than R. NIGHTMARES: YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE deliveryS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE. Jake\\'s: I did not like this delivery because it was not like a complete product. Scary when I was little, not years later. Horrified, and not in a good way: To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these deliverys!, My highschool age son can\\'t recall any of the stories but still talks about the \"super creepy\" pictures. Warning for customers: Any productteller can tell you that there\\'s little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. This was just a mistake. Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations: I love Brett Helquist. Not the delivery from your childhood. Bring back Gammell: The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. My Childhood! :(: While the stories are good, what made these deliverys for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. Not the Best Version: While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children\\'s delivery, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell\\'s illustrations. After 13 years, I still can\\'t look in the mirror at night: My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. You Think the deliverys are Creepy? Listen to the cassettes!: I remember goting these as a kid and then buying all of them a few years later. LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. Buy the original. Replacing Gammell\\'s art is a mistake!: This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell\\'s illustrations. Disaster: The new illustrations are a complete disaster. Gammell Made this Series Great: With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there\\'s nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children\\'s delivery and I adored it when I was young. Artistically censored, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION!: While walking through Barnes and Noble after Christmas, I was wondering how to spend my gift card. Great for product telling: While I do admit that these stories are no longer capable of scaring me, I also understand the fact that. This is an amazing collection of folklore!!!: This delivery came out a long time ago. Not what I remembered as a kid. Good for younger goters: [got by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I got some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic.

Average Lost Civilization Fantasy: Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5. Course includes audio, but Amazon does not sell that part. Racism and Sex: This would have been a very short delivery if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. A disappointment: Is this an exercise video?

Not My Favorite: I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. Excellent introduction, not workout video. Great Introduction - A classic: This was one of the first Bellydance instructional videos on the market and I believe Atea did not have the in front of the camera experience and production assistance of many of the slicker more current videos/DVDs.

Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor. the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it\\'s so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. buying cd eurovision delux: It would be helpful if you could put what songs are on this cd as I have a few and wouldn\\'t like to duplicate them. mediocre: i didn\\'t care for this cd. great: Great tools well made heavy duty can not beat then for the price would recommend to anyone looking for good tools.

Your Signature Life: Pursuing God\\'s Best Every Day: This is a beautifully got delivery that helps us to understand how what we say & do affects other peoples life\\'s both at the work place and in our daily life. Asimov\\'s early work his best: The best example around of Asimov\\'s work. I almost got the whole thing!!!: 50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, goting newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy. B-O-R-I-N-G: This has to be one of the worst deliverys i EVER picked up. Waste of time;Stick to Robot novels. Trite, simple, unimaginative: What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. What a disappointment: As an avid sci-fi goter, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and got the delivery that really is a foundation of much of today\\'s sci-fi. Melodramatic pulp: Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. Made myself finish this one to say I\\'d got it: I know! I\\'m as surprised as you are that I didn\\'t enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-gots, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. Wonderful delivery, except for the part with all the words. Classic Sci-Fi: I decided to regot the Asimov series in order. Classic SF: The middle of a trilogy that should be got in sequence. Disappointing: I have heard so much about this delivery over the years but didn\\'t like Asimov\\'s writing so I never got it. Seldon knows better. Outstanding Sequel!: This is the second Foundation Novel I have got in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This was the best delivery that I have ever got!: Foundation is the complete delivery of adventure. Fantastic!: This product is epic. A sci-fi classic: Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know. zzzzzz. It\\'s NOT the FIRST delivery. Epic? Not hardly. Interesting productline: I\\'m not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. Odd, yet unique sci-fi producttelling . Not Free SF goter: The second delivery in the foundation trilogy is again a product combination, but this two two novella length works. Science Fiction 101: So, you\\'re thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don\\'t know where to start. Good? You bet. Not A Great delivery By Any Means, But Well got: Political space tales aren\\'t really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Bor-ring!: I couldn\\'t wait to got the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it\\'s been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi  Companys. what masterpiece?: This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. This is a cult delivery. The grandfather of SF deliverys: If you\\'re only going to got one SF delivery, this is the one. The first delivery of the best series ever. Text to speech disabled = no sale: I got this delivery as a teenager and was excited to be reminded of it recently. No Canadians allowed. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. Didn\\'t Believe a Word of It: I enjoy Asmov\\'s science deliverys. Foundation: The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. One of the worst things I\\'ve ever got: This has to be one of the most over rated deliverys (and series) of all time. Foundation [is not good]: . Give the man SOME credit: Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were got in the 1940\\'s! Must you blame Mr. Good delivery: I really liked this delivery,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people\\'s perspectives at different periods of time. On with the foundation: Unlike the first Foundation delivery, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. Going deeper: I got this delivery after coming blind to the foundation deliverys - I\\'ve never got Asimov in a novel before. The Zenith of Asimov!: I highly recommend the time to got \"Foundation\". goting can seldom be this much fun!: Foundation is a great delivery to got. Confused about \"classic\" status: Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who gots this delivery and is thoroughly underwhelmed. Piece of crap from crap seller: I ordered this delivery 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. A Dud: Pssst! The Emperor has no clothes. Poorly got: This novel has a lot of ideas that do not fit together. He wants more. Well, it\\'s Asimov: This delivery has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding producttelling style and pace. Dry Sci-Fi: I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. Ahead Of His Time. THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE: I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. A very well writen, exciting delivery about a possible future of: This delivery, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Great delivery for any Age: I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3. Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic product: Before \"Foundation\" i\\'d got somes short-products from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars: This delivery is a highly cereberal study of hiproduct. Good novel, but the other deliverys in the series are better. Get this delivery: Get this delivery! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!: Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF). Classic: I hadn\\'t got this since I was a teenager. If you like SF this is the one delivery you should got: If you have the patience to got the first 100 pages you\\'ll not be able to put this delivery aside. Science Fiction Masterpiece: Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel got by the late IsaacAsimov. Perhaps the finest sci fi series of all time: In reviewing the delivery Foundation I am recommending that you got all of the Foundation deliverys by Asimov. Best delivery by Asimov (fiction): I have got almost all of Asimov\\'s fiction, and this delivery is by far one of the best. One of the best ever: This delivery it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever got. Just kidding around: This delivery was hilarious. Still hasn`t arrived after two months: The delivery was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. The Genius of Asimov: I had got the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20\\'s. Foundation and the complete series: Couldn\\'t put any of the deliverys in this series down. Unique transposition of our hiproduct: It\\'s my third got of this delivery. Psycohiproduct: When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don\\'t make many friends. A true Science Fiction Master!: As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other delivery. Foundation is a good got for all goters especially scfi fans: Foundation is not easy to got since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. Amazing Asimov got !!!!!!: I can\\'t say enough about this delivery, weather you like SF or not this delivery is a MUST got!!! It\\'s more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it. Not my style: The delivery covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. first but not the best: No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the product telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time. letdown after the first delivery: I realize I\\'m in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don\\'t feel this delivery is even close to being half as good as the first foundation delivery. Just not my kind of delivery - Others liked it. Misleading: The title of this item says \"(3 deliverys boxed set. I just cant do it. Why is kindle version so expensive???!: Publisher: I will NOT buy a delivery that has been on the market since the middle of the last century in paperless format for these kind of prices. A very bad delivery: . An Example of What is \"Classically\" Wrong with SciFi. Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline: This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. Good printer, so so on photos, crap for envelopes. TERRIBLE PRINTER: I\\'ve had this printer for a while now, and i rarely can get it to work properly. Don\\'t do it!: I\\'ve had HP printers for years and have always liked them. DULLSVILLE: I saw his film when it was originally released. The Brainwashing of the American Investor: Brainwashing of the American Investor provided invaluable insight into today\\'s Wall Street. A realistic approach to taking profits. A must got if you want to save your money from the \" SHARKS: got in a conversational style with plenty of humor, this delivery gives you the questions and answers you need to keep and increase monies that are being put away for investing and retirement. Excellent!: Some of the reviews I\\'ve heard and got here and elsewhere contain criticism of Mr Selengut\\'s journalistic style, grammar, spelling and even the relatively amateur way the delivery appears to have been typeset. a few good ideas spun out way too long: There are a few decent things here, for example the  Company\\'s idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the goter Wall Street \"secrets\", and not enough hard analysis. Don\\'t waste your time: Ridiculously hard to follow the random thoughts of Mr. Right on the Money!: I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson\\'s radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. Investing Made Successful: I heard Steven Selengut on a talk-radio program and was intrigued by the premise of the delivery. Still swings after all these years: For an album recorded nearly 1/2 a century ago (December 1956), Swinging Kicks doesn\\'t sound outdated. West Coast - Forever C-O-O-L!: OK, so this album (whoops - gave my age away there. Childish and lacking creativity. Energizers and Icebreakers Very Good for 4-H Club: We are using the activities from this delivery at our 4-H Club meetings. What are these guys?: Oh man.

Puts into words and ideas moral concepts that can be difficult to explain: I have a sixteen-year-old who is questioning all morals. a great guide for a christian parent, or any parent: Very well got. Stopped Cold: I had seen this  Companys\\' works offered for free on the Kindle page and since the price was right downloaded two of them. Ignore the heading, it\\'s NOT compatible with HP P1538A: I ordered this part as an upgrade for my HP e-pc c10 which requires specifically HP part P1538A. Big Disappointment: This delivery was a major disappointment for me. Great for Begginers: This delivery is perfect for begginers. Great! Must have it!: This delivery is a hands on training. Not worth watching. passable Product yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored: This Product is slightly digestible yet, for having \"A list\" delivary man and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual. Bad, just bad. Drawn out: After goting the reviews I was excited to watch this film. Good acting but plot is stupid and it is not in any sense likable. Booooooring: Alright, this Product is boring. It doth suck. trying hard but fail to impress: If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. I\\'d give it a zero if it would let me: Total trash, not worth the dvd it\\'s got on. love it: great Product!!! cage is a great druggie i mean for being a cop. A hoot: This is a highly amusing Product shot and acted superbly. Glad I have prime and it was free: Wife is a huge cage fan. Just Don\\'t: Bad. Is this Product a joke?: Couldn\\'t watch more than 30 minutes. Crap: This is a crap Product. Huge Waste of Time: Clean your house instead. Terrible!: Probably a decent product line but Nicolas Cage just needs to stop doing Products. junk: I tried giving this Product a chance. bad isn\\'t fitting: can not believe I watched the whole Product, I kept hoping it could get better. One of 2010\\'s Best films: Get this Product!! If you like Quentin Tarantino, you\\'ll love this incredible ride of a film. Worst Product EVER!: Horrible Product, worst I have ever seen! Nick Cage\\'s career is definitely over if it wasn\\'t before this piece of garbage!. AWFUL!: I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage Product I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap Product and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that Product, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at. not good: the service was good on this Product. SUCKS: this Product was the longest. Lost: 121 minutes: Well, that\\'s 121 minutes of my life I\\'ll never get back. Dumb, Bad, Really Bad: This was one of the worst Products I have seen in a long time. All Nicolas Cage: He is such a good delivary man that he can take this \"plot\" and make a good Product out of it. Genius? Puh-lease! It\\'s self gratifying garbage: I generally like Nick Cage even in his bad Products. Drowning at midnight: I enjoyed this. Awful: It\\'s just an awful Product. Horribly Bad: Begs comparisons to Keitel\\'s original and fails on every level. Bad Lieutenant: Terrible Product from beginning to end, I stuck with this to see if it would get better but no! two hours later I wished I had gone out side and washed the car. Bad Lieutenant = Bad Product: I gave up on this thing halfway through. Very Bad Product: Till now I\\'ve never seen a bad Nicolas Cage Product, this would be the first. The Worst Product Ever: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This Product only goes to show that Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer are definitely washed up as delivary man. Horrible Lieutenant: Worst Nicholas Cage Product ever made. this Product is awful: there is no words to describe this Product! all i can say this Product sucks and it was awful!. What a complete waste of time: This is one of the worst Products I\\'ve seen in a long-long time. Bad, bad Product: Even Cage, with some genius acting in parts, couldn\\'t save this bad Product. Horrible acting, writing, directing: All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. INFORMATION NEEDED: If you are a very senior Senior, be careful of the pop-up enticements you do not understand.

Not quite the booze I expected: This is an updated publication of a c. Ethanol is for drinking: I would not recommend this delivery. Needs a better string quartet: As a musician and musicology student, I am very familar with both the \"classical\" world of music, and the popular world of music, and I have to say that perhaps string quartet versions of R. Regarding Tribute to REM String Quartet. Not a tribute -- a disgrace!: A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. Skip the quartet, and go for the whole orchestra. Lock Lace Brown: Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. Great item!: I bought these as a replacement when our new puppy chewed the end off of a similar type lace on my husband\\'s favorite shoes. Difficult to attach to boots: Too difficult to attach to my shoes. 2 Unlimited is back, but not as you\\'d expect them to. Finches love it but so do squirrels: This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. Missing parts: I received this bird feeder, liked it, but when I tried to assemble it someof the parts were missing. It\\'s finally gonna happen!!! WhooHoo!!!: I can\\'t believe this is finally coming to DVD!Three\\'s Company has always been my \\'all time\\' favorite show. Great service: I was very happy with my product I absolutely love it!!! And it was brand new at a very reasonable price. 2nd season: Great item. Always delivers the laughs. horrid DVD: Love the show, which for me has held up well: it\\'s obviously dated but still makes me laugh. Clear cut disc: no problems whatsoeverI remember why I love the show so muchthis DVD is much cheaper here than at other retailersI wonder why though only 6 episodes on the 1st season. Comedy doesn\\'t get much better!: I remember watching Three\\'s Company on TV, and I\\'m so glad it\\'s available on DVD now. A OK ~ Three\\'s Company Season 1: I\\'m glad Three\\'s Company was put on DVD. Best Show Ever!!: I loved Three\\'s Company since I was a child, John Ritter is hilarious. Show=Amazing , DVD=RUSHED: One of my favorite shows ever, the DVD itself was rushed to capitalize on John Ritter\\'s death. Can\\'t wait no longer. A lesson to be learned: I thought that because the DVD stated Season One that I was getting the entire season one. Why not Spanish ???: Alguien me puede decir porque la serie Three\\'s Company no viene ni con audio ni con subtitulos en ESPAÑOL. JACK THE IDJIT: I think Three\\'s Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Where\\'s your underwear?!!!!!: I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. A Legend: Three\\'s Company will always be the best comedy show that was on TV. three\\'s company: I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. Spanish: In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Classic!: Yes, you can catch this program running in syndication frequently on many different channels, so why buy it?

Very Funny: These are just as funny now as it was when i was little. Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money: I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. Not of good quality!: In the picture it seems bright, cool, So I ordered! I received it few days back. did not warm up to the delivery: the delivery came highly recommended, but it didnt humor me and I couldnt warm up to the  Companys style of writing. Buy Things From These People: I ordered a rare CD that I had a lot of trouble finding in other places. if you are buying cuz of Pearl Jam don\\'t. Netherlands?: If it is called Hard Wired in Ljubljana, why was it recorded somewhere in the Netherlands? Ljubljana is in Slovenia--a country on the other side of Europe. Nasty delivery, nasty woman: From a woman who sold out her body ages ago and now attempts to be a partisan hack, and poorly at that. Hot non-fiction: If you\\'ve ever thought about working in the porn industry, even as someone behind the video camera, photo lens or website, this delivery gives you a good idea of what you are in for. Romero x Rambo: Curiously, the track #36 (To Canada) was used in the 1st teaser trailer of the new Rambo Product. Buzzing renders it useless: It\\'s light, it\\'s convenient, it\\'s easy to use. great beginner cam: one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. Easy to use!: -Excellent little camcorder. Love it!: Well, I\\'m going to have to bunk on the previous reviewer. very good. Another nightmare about the remove cassette message: I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. Very annoying humming sound - be sure it doesn\\'t bother you: Basically a nice unit. I liked it at first: It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!: I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept \\'02. Great Camera: This is a very easy to use camera with excellent video. Not good enough: This camcorder is good enough for me except for one thing: if you are going to need a light or external microphone you should get the ZR50MC because of its advanced accessory shoe. Remove the cassetter problem. Horrible. Nice camera, when it works: I love the features and optics of this camera. Gets the job done right!: I have two long haired cats and these are by far my favorite lint rollers--super sticky and gets the job done in record time. A great CD: Yeah, yeah, we know she has a loaded last name; anyway, a CD ought to be listened to on its own merits. 5:55 Charlotte Gainsbourg: What a great album!!! I never knew she sang as well. She can\\'t sing!: This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I\\'d give it a listen. hollow, lame and prescindible. KAY ARE A PEE: Um, hello? Has anyone noticed that this woman doesn\\'t know how to sing? Most songs are an over-baked litany of melodramatic metaphors that add up to . A different Charlotte: Charlotte Gainsbourg 5:55 borrows more from \"Air\" than from her father Serge, and is a complete departure from her previous works. Red Allen\\'s hot session: Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra (\"Queer Notions\" and some other songs). Reporting World War II, Part Two: My wife is the goter and she dearly loved this delivery. korny: One of the worst compilations ever. Excellent Ski Tours for the Western Sierra: This delivery has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. A Watershed Work!: This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that\\'s very easy for Westerners to understand. A good review of the facts . Not for novices: Not very useful. A Good Synopsis of Mainstream Buddhism: The contrived question and answer format didn\\'t bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must delivery: from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. Provides a great foundation for further studies. Excellent!: I have several photography deliverys that I have had no desire to got from cover to cover. great delivery, good service: The delivery arrived in a little more time than I expected, but it was within the time frame indicated. Good Overall delivery: I just took a photography course and this delivery was one of the ones recommended. KISS Guide to Photography: While old and out of print, this delivery is a very good way to learn the basics of photography. outdated!!! although several delivery been out there for a long time, this delivery is also basic: I bought this delivery two months ago. Plastic pulley, not metal. Mixed Bag: This compilation contains some of the best jazz guitar ever in songs like Scotland I, the Jam with Albert and Yin. Great take on unlikely standards. Belkin poser: Ordered a Belkin, got something unknown. Should be Free with purchase of Belkin OmniView. Amigo?????: I ordered a BELKIN and received an AMIGO. Delicious Electronics. Not As Engaging As I Had Hoped: I\\'m not a huge dance/techno/electronica/call-it-what-you-want fan, but I do dabble. Not as good as Counterfeit CD. Reaaally sucks!!!: The only song that\\'s worth listening to on this album is \"Break in\" and it can be found on Superstar DJ Keoki\\'s \"Transatlantic move\". AWESOME: I love this delivery. Can\\'t Get Enough of GLAD\\'s Acapella Projects: Like most things in my life I experienced GLAD in reverse of release dates. Great got: Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can\\'t happen to them should got this delivery. Loved this delivery: You hear about prescription drug addiction but don\\'t really understand it. Still One of the Best: A number of deliverys about substance abuse have come out since \"I\\'m Dancing as Fast as I Can,\" but it still should be on the deliveryshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Very good heart wrenching product: I got this delivery many years ago. Now I\\'m confused ;-): I got this delivery 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Review of delivery: I didn\\'t care for this delivery at all - in fact, I stopped goting it several times because it droned on and on about the writer\\'s depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to got about her recovery - and after more than half of the delivery behind me, I was still looking for that. Liked it: This was a fascinating look at mental illness. Needy: She seemed to be \"ill\" when it was convenient for her. realistic: I found this delivery very realistic. dry: This delivery was really dry. great delivery BUT DONT BUY THIS VERSION: Not sure exactly what went wrong here - but this version of the delivery is RIDDLED with laughable typos. Out of date: fading fast: When got, this deliverys topic was well known. Also useful if you live in Europe: You got a lot of deliverys, when you have a relative with lung cancer. VERY limited lifespan: I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Mean Guns: This Product is not for everyone. Dumb Guns. Mean Guns Doesn\\'t Mean Any Good: This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder: I\\'ve now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). A very strange and bad Product: Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!: I was very disappointed in this delivery. OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream: Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. A lovely delivery, but short on specifics. Excellent and informative: This is a very clear, thorough, well-got delivery. Packed with info: I was looking for a delivery about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. Very useful eye candy. Not worth it: Fairly poor. weak advice: The best thing I found in this delivery is the picture on the cover. Nearly Sanders Best: It took a while to get into this cd. Great CD: This is a great CD. He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!: This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn\\'t get it. Avoid: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Good stuff: I have always had trouble finding the perfect toner for my skin type. Amazing: Within 24 hours of using this product there is algoty a huge difference in my skin. Can you do basic math and science, MGM?: Mad Max and Escape From New York are two titles I would consider essential to have in my BD collection, but I will not be buying them in their present state. Is this remastered version?: What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. VERRRRRYYYYYYY GOOD: This Product is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this Product hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes. Mad Max to the Max! Well, almost. Cult classic. I LIKE TURTLES: I LIKE TURTLES. Great Product: a good collection and will be a long time favorite a Product to be never forgotten. Fitting beginnng of an epic: \"Mad Max,\" the first film in a much-imitated but never equalled \"action\" tragedy/trilogy, perfectly sets up the following two Products. PLEASEEEEEEE: IF WHAT YOU SAID KENNETH MARBURY IS TRUE, EVERYONE GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET THIS DIRECTOR\\'S CUT WITH THE ORIGINAL ACCENT AND THE CUT SCENES. Buy It!: The first Product in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. CLASSIC ACTION Product: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Warning - badly dubbed dvd: Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American delivary man replace the Australian delivary man on the soundtrack. The Special Edition has arrived - BUY IT NOW!: This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released. Mad Max (Special Edition): I won\\'t go into a review of the Product itself as there are many on here algoty. Cut Version: Guess I should\\'ve known better than to buy a \"special edition\" This has scenes edited out. typical chick flick: What you\\'re looking at here -- or at least, the product I think I\\'m writing this review for -- is the very first \"Mad Max,\" the one that put a young Mel Gibson on the map. Solid Prequel to Superior \"Warrior\": Finally this thing has been enhanced for surround. Post Apocolyptic Action At Its Best: A post-apocolyptic wasteland. Great work! Fuel injected suicide DVD!!: Wish I have a MAD MAX 2 DVD like this!! This is a great DVD, with the 2 versions on it!! the American dubbed version is a great wild cartooned Product. Mad Max (1979): A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement, this George Miller flick features a young, then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second Product role, as top-cop Max Rockatansky. Dubbed into American English: This DVD is the U. Blah: I thought this Product was boring and it didn\\'t let you get to know any of the characters. Mad Max is Cult Classic: How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under? Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang. This is where \"road-rage\" originates!: If you worry about how much you pay for gas, got this delivery! END. Nothing more than car crashes: Why on earth would anyone give this Product three and a half stars (out of the traditional four star system)? I kept watching this tedious film, hoping that perhaps the answer might be found in the next scene. Mad Rod: For a long time i\\'ve been waiting for this dvd, it becames my way of life, i bought a CB750 and a F-100 V8. Cult Classic: In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Cool early effort of Mel Gibson: Mad Max is a very good Product. Mad Max 1: I\\'m a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I\\'m living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. The best of the Mad Max triolgy: The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn\\'t be understood by American audiences. Mad Mel: I wouldn\\'t waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in. This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic Products, I must say that this Product is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic Product can get. Possibly the worst Product I\\'ve ever seen: I thought this was going to be a good Product. Don\\'t buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market: It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. Not worth buying!: I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it\\'s hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original Product!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic Product (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the Product is!!!. Gives you a nice urban \\'western\\' type film - Mel , not Clint: This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call . Great: Bought for my BF. not as go as the road warrior,but a very good low-budget action Product: in this first mad max Product mel gibson(looking very young) is a cop in the near future where war and crime is pushing the world into a new and deadly dark age. Good revenge-type Product: If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. mad max: this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed. When do we go for a ride?!: Ever since the first time I watched this Product, I have loved it. Dubs are BAD: Do not, under any circumstances, get this Product dubbed if you have the same opportunity to get it in its original sound format, with the original voices. Dubbing is bad: Good Product, bad dubbing. A household name. Red only when off. Barely red enough: Sold as red, obviously. The Sword in The Stone: There are parts in the delivery that start to bore you at times. The sword in the sux: Well iu thin that this delivery should\\'ve had a first delivery.

If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not goting this delivery, u should take advantage of it. There\\'s different versions of this product!: T. Thin and bends easily, but very pretty: I really liked this ring. fairies dancing on my head: I found this cd on the shelf at my work. Worth the effort it might take: Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. A complex, multi-layered masterpiece: Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn\\'t reach out and grab you at first. Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. Huh?: I loved Carabee and Moghul, and I thought Samurai would be more historical fiction, but I was sadly disappointed. disappointing: Hoover\\'s choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Japanese high finance mystery: Interesting product about how Japanese business and government could take over American business and technologyRealistic people portrayed from both sides of the Pacific. Decent shoe: Good, sturdy platform for squatting under a barbell. Fun. Fun fantasy: I love the product line of this Product - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. Make a wish!: \\'A Simple Wish\\' is a cute, fun family film. Family film: I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. GOOd: a gift for my friend he loved it is a child Product and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping. Cute film: This is a fun film about a girl who wants a wish, and a fairy godmother (or in this case, godfather) Her wish is not even for herself, it is for her father. Mara Wilson: I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful. A little of everything: The plot and cinematography of this film were above average, while other aspects were a little lackluster. A must see!: This Product is very entertaining to both adults and children. Well worth seeing! Martin Short is excellent!: We rented the video and then went out and bought it. Happy Escapist: Call me an escapist, but I love this delivery. A stimulating toy but a little too heavy and hard: My daughter first started reaching for this toy at about 4 months old. Easy to hold rattle: This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. Voltaire - Genius of Mockery: Voltaire Genius of Mockery delivery is about the life of Voltaire, French philosopher, poet and novelist. Poor quality: I ordered this clock. Upbeat Christmas Songs That\\'ll Get You In The Spirit: If you don\\'t like Kenneth Copeland, then please don\\'t write dumb, childish reviews that have nothing to do with the product. Ask Santa for some ear plugs: Home for Christmas. Mini Blinds something I always put off cleaning. Product did not work like I thought it would: Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. Did not like: I did not like this item or how it worked.

Highly disappointed: I bought this to be a part of my daughter\\'s train set, and have been nothing but disappointed. Peace & Positivity: This CD is blazin\\'.

Great documentary on a great album. THE BAND: THE BROWN ALBUM: When the \"Classic\" series of videos came out, I could only wish for anything on The Band. Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in Hiproduct: This is one of those Products that I didn\\'t want to end. A must for fans of The Band: This is a terrific video - especially if you are a fan of The Band. The Band: Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. Blah Blah Blah. You\\'re Kidding!: I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65. The Naturalist\\'s Guide: This delivery is literally a Naturalist\\'s guide. BROKE after a short time, not truly waterproof, way too large, and smells like rubber: This item broke after a very short time of use. Terrible: After repeated washings, it still smelled like a toxic plastic and who wants to put toxic plastic inside their body. Great power, not great shape: The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. way too big: This product is NOT intended for a beginner. ridiculous: I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product .

Not waterproof!: It\\'s not water proof and it rusts on the inside.

PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE: WASTE OF MONEY. Doesnt work: First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. Yuck: This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can\\'t even use it! I\\'ve washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it \"air out,\" all to no avail. A Little Too Much: I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. well: i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. Painful, no pleasure, and doesn\\'t work. Beware-Can\\'t return if defective as this one is!!!!!!!: This product would not even turn on once batteries were installed!

Large and Hard!: Purchased online, good description with size included. Great Quality Toy: This is great, wife loves it. Too Weak/Gentle: Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. hubby vs wife: shipped fast good price good explanation of the detail and all other great aspects of this item. Not for me: It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . one hit wonder: I tried this product. WOW!!: This product definitely does what is said to do. Horrible!: I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. A quiet ride. Great Transaction!!!: Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. Not a good vibrator: I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE: This is TERRIBLE. Disappointed: I was really excited to receive this product after goting the reviews. Awful: I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. California Exotics jack rabbit: Piece of crap. Not waterproof: I only used it a couple of times, a tiny bit of water leaked into the battery compartment and now it is rusted and won\\'t turn on. sooo biggggg: I had mixed reviews of this product. Great after positioned right!: I got this today. Seems to be good!: This seems to be good so far only used it once. Nothing: Nothing to to say about it thank u didn\\'t enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money. Disappointing: Once again I wish I\\'d paid closer attention to the more critical reviews . disappointed: I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response. wow: Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised, fast deliver an great service, thanks. Ouch!: The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. Jack Rabbit: The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work. Outstanding in and out of water: My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. The worst ever: This is one of the worst one i ever bought. Awesome once you find your rhythym!: I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). Reviews are so off--terrible!: I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit\\'s beads froze the first time I used it. Works like a charm: For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. False Advertising: The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has \"alternate views\" showing these items. Not waterproof!: This thing is awful! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. Holy Crap!!!: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it.

And this is the best price I found on the Internet! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon! Good luck. BORING!: I have enjoyed all the Fleetwood Mac albums and thought this video would provide excellent sound tracks from their album Rumors. YOU DON\\'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS: This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac\\'s Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. Misleading. Zero Stars: Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. A \"Box of Chocolates\": I\\'m really upset with myself for not more closely goting the reviews that said there wasn\\'t music, just talking about the songs. A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!: THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I\\'VE EVER SEEN! I\\'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM \\'RUMORS\\' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). Very satisfying and informative. Don\\'t be fooled this is just a documental: No one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion. Buy something else: The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. eBay, here I come!: Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text. Fleetwood Mac Rumours: If you want to hear music, don\\'t purchase this video. Confused: I was very much disappointed with this album. Rumours DVD: The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. disapointed after watching \"The Dance\": Having seen \"The Dance\" before, I was totally disappointed. It\\'s just a nice to OK documentary: It\\'s disappointing to say the least. entertaining but could have been better: If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. Absolutely wonderful!: I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn\\'t wear out!), it should be obvious that I\\'m ecstatic about the music. too frustrating for the price: Just bought this at the garden center. So easy: I had no problem setting times and days for the unit to run it is so easy, I have also purchased 2 of the double outlet timers of the same make so that did make easy for me to set the single timer. It\\'s all good!: This timer is AWESOME! It\\'s very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won\\'t hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs. Solid water timer: I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer. Not recommended: Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect. 1. uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it\\'s onset in 1989 or 1990. If I was stranded on a desert island with one album. Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family\\'s move to Umbria. Like the sprial binding, not much else: The spiral binding on this delivery is it\\'s only positive. Garbage. Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. Paper on \"hand decorated\" box looks cheap: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation: Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro\\'s students who do good. My First Negative Review -- Ever: Others may like this delivery but I did not. One of the best: I enjoyed this delivery tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a product that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf. Good delivery: I love the delivery by George C. Not what you think. George Elliot\\'s Romola: In my opinion, this is a must-got for anyone who has ever been to Florence. everything you expect from George Eliot: Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-got. Ripped Off: Not worth the money at all. Entire CS3 family crashes: Effects isn\\'t the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes. Patti Page attempts to sing jazz. Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing. The best eye gel I\\'ve ever used!!: I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don\\'t look it!. Amazing! Entertaining! I didn\\'t want to miss a second!: I enjoyed every minute of this captivating, lively, and fun extreme sport documentary. Their Great Recordings on Vee-Jay: This has 32 tracks from their late 50\\'s early 60\\'s Vee-Jay recordings, including the complete LP Will The Circle Be Unbroken, oop since 1992. I HATE IT: OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US got IT AND WE HAD TO DO A delivery REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!. Grainy image: I can\\'t resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too. Uses yellow ink: I would not buy this printer again. dont bother with XP: I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Photosmart pretty dumb: Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Epson is better and bad software driver: My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. Disappointed: I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. HP workhorse: Great Printer, but does get a bit cranky at times. Neat delivery for starters into continuous-time finance: Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance. one elephant charm? you\\'ve got to be kidding. KI A Road Anyone Can walk: This is a very interesting delivery describing KI and how anyone can use it for various applications in life. Spare us: I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother\\'s Day. Junk Music: Stop listening to her music years ago. dissapointing: dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. Boring: Who\\'d Have Thought?: Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS\\'s voice sounds worn and tired. Has Streisand stayed too long at the fair? NO,NO,NO. Great musice but dissapointed in the actual concert: The music is ok on this, yes her voice isn\\'t what is was in the past but everyone gets older. 10 Stars at Least!: Brilliant recording, great songs, just enough flavour of the concert without too much talking, not enough singing. Streisand:Live in Concert (2 CD\\'s): This is one of the best Barbra has ever done, I have listened to it in full probably ten times since last week when I bought it. AMAZING: I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my CD. Like Buttah!: Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!. Streisand Live - Amazing: Barbra Streisand for over 46 years has been an entertainer beyond words. great writing, informative: Every goter of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America\\'s government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy. Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!!: This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. Too Small: Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. Maybe this is only for coffee beans. Filter compartment smaller than I thought: Love the look and quality. Costs $10. misleading cd: This is not Lighthouse. Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware: Received this as a gift from my husband. Great idea--terrible design!: Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. Big Disappointment: I purchased this for my son who is a huge Justice League fan. Bad Design, just buy the figures: We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you. A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had got the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don\\'t stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don\\'t want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it\\'s own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!. Don\\'t waste your money: This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. A very bad choice: The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. A PIECE OF JUNK!: Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Don\\'t waste your money: This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it. Not for children to PLAY with!: This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you\\'ll soon be hearing screams of frustration. Garbage!: My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend!: I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. Not very durable: This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. A nice showpiece but falls apart with the slightest touch!: What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. Son loves it, but it does fall apart: My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. Another lame mattel product: Please don\\'t waste your money on this one. Watchtower is total crap!!: Avoid this toy at all cost. My daughter loves this toy: I bought this for Christmas. A peice of Junk: When you put it standing up on its legs, it falls down. A toy not made to last: This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. Very well acted and directed: While the first half feels predictable and very TV Product, theperformances are good enough (especially Helen Mirren) to keep itgoing. A World Within a World: \"A World Within a World\" says it all. Poor reliability: I have had several of these monitors. I am returning it today. Dead Pixels: I\\'ve had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year. Not sure that this is a great product .

No Cocktails For Me, Thanks: I love all of Sophie Kinsella\\'s deliverys and her writing style. Where is her tell-tale wit?!: I was so disappointed with this delivery! I\\'m a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella\\'s deliverys under the name SK and have got all of them many times, but this was the first delivery I\\'d got got under her name Madeleine Wickham. Keep em coming!: Classic Chick-lit. A harlequin romance for the new age: OK. Boring. okay: I liked the delivery but it wasn\\'t one of my favorite gots. Cocktail For Three: Love, love, love! Got this for a \"beach got\" & fell in love with the characters. Entertaining delivery: It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good delivery. A Fun got: I didn\\'t realize until I picked up this title at my local Borders that Sophie Kinsella wrote under another name - Madeleine Wickham. A good summer got: This is unlike the other deliverys that i have got so far. hard to got--both format and content: This delivery is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word \"pleasure\" spelled out as one word. A Rare Find - Wonderful!: I\\'ve been searching for a delivery that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a product that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. A Little Disappointing: I loved all of Sophie Kinsella\\'s deliverys. Hated it so much I returned it: I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her deliverys under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. Good chick lit!: This was a very good, fun light got. Skip it: Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. Eby dead! 12/27/02: Contrary to Dr. Encouraging Testimony of Life After Death Experience: This is a fantastic life after death experience got by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. Inspiring, but please don\\'t defend fraudulent claims: I went to hear Dr. Very poor condition BUT? Good got!: I saw D. This delivery changed my life!: Dr. An absolutely uplifting delivery -- an incredible product: One of the better deliverys that I\\'ve got over the past year.

Dark Fantasy with MORALS: I loved this delivery, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. My Favorite Shakespeare: The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. as advertised: It was the product my daughter needed for school. It was better in the Product: Well, it was very romantic and very imaginative, totally complicated and fantastic to analyze, very emotional. Feedback: I ordered textdeliverys for my child\\'s high school classes. Excellent!: My 15 year old daughter is using this for her English/Drama studies. Disappointed: I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. Great delivery!: Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful got. Wow. Don\\'t watch this delivery. Never got here. Great for mature Sixth Graders!: I use Romeo and Juliet as a unit in my literature class, but only when I have a mature class of Sixth Graders. Good, but footnotes are too much. I hate it. Great delivery and all but. Amazing for struggling goters: I ordered this delivery for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet. Shakespeare: As we all have one time or another, had to got shakespeare in school for English class. this delivery makes it very easy to understand the writing in this delivery. wrong cover: I guess maybe it said they have the right to change the cover, but the one we received was completely different! Looked like an old Harlequin romance novel. Not new as stated: This product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the delivery. notes are not on the left page - get the other version: There are 2 versions of this delivery available on Amazon. Romeo & Juliet: Experienced no problems with the order. Complex Love: I have seen all Product versions about Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet and still love the delivery everytime I revisit the product. Very Disappointed: I bought this delivery based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. Not Impressed: This delivery does not have line numbers. Very difficult to hear: If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. Literary junk food for the masses: Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out. Romeo and Juliet, the tragic product review: As I didn\\'t liked the product at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the delivery, I would do it in modern English. stupid student review by gabriel c: Romeo and Juliet is a product about to lovers that meet at first sight. the Product was better: i just got this delivery. Signet Shakespeare Kindle verions: To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. Does not match picture. Warnings for teachers trying to use this in your classrooms: Here are the problems with using this in the classroom:1. Basic Romeo and Juliet: I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the edelivery--gotability, layout, price, and other features. delivery review: Shipped promptly! Just what dauther needed and in time for her to got for her English class! I would recommend!. R&J-Summary By EricaH: Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. I don\\'t know: I don\\'t know want the delivery is about yet Hahaha so can I got now? Thank you ? This is I don\\'t know. Love Unrealized: This play taught: That love cannot survive prejudice, young love is powerful because it is raw, no one can control nature, and more.

A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have got. nan. Shakespeare\\'s best!: I love this play. Cliche, lacks literary value: This is probably the most cliche novel ever got. Gimmie A Break!: Not that I don\\'t like Shakespeare\\'s works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one.

The Best of Shakespeare: This is the best tragedy ever got. Very mediocre, middle of the road collection: That sums up this collection well. A must have: If you\\'re a Dolly Parton fan (even somewhat of a fan), this is a must have for your collection. A Really good Overview: I have always dug Dolly Parton&this Double Disc Set is a must have for any Newbie getting into Dolly\\'s Work. Moxy Unleashed: This is a live cd(2002), with all of their great hits from all the albums combined. Very Thorough, yet Tough to got: Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary gots full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. copy shop edition: The stars are for the edition, not the delivery. Binge: British Light Music: Never ordered it, it was sent by mistake and I returned it upon receipt without even opening it so I don\\'t know. Really, how is a Product like this sold to anyone?: It\\'s a blatant ripoff of Predators and not even a good one at that. massivie waste of time: this by far the most ,waste time i have ever spent on a Product let a lone money. Would rather watch grass grow: I have seen many many Products in my life and this one takes the cake as being the biggest waste of time, terrible film I have EVER seen. KEVIN SORBO: This is a good Product. A very, very cheap rip off of predators. A curmudgeon review: Ok, military soldiers have short hair cuts, but not Sorbo. pound the booty for 20 min. 15 Minutes of Cable Access Style Bio: If you want a low-tech, outdated, poorly produced micro-biography of Ralph Ellison that runs about 15 minutes (that\\'s right--ignore the time posted above because it certainly isn\\'t 30), then this may be what you are looking for. Protect a bed mattress cover: I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. Fabulous: I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. Bad cutting and way too big: It\\'s definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. Doesn\\'t fit well/hard to take off: I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model\\'s costume. Not cut well: This costume is poorly cut. hmm. Cheap: This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn\\'t look great on or last well. Cheap Quality: Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Earring case: Unable to use. Wish I could Order this Item: I could really use this Item but I won\\'t order it if I cannot order the color that I want; guess I\\'ll have to look elsewhere. No Choice of color???: It\\'s simple. Another Lost Sale: I too was goty to buy this product, but will not do it if I can\\'t get the color I choose. Color does matter: Like the others, I will not buy this item unless I can chose the color. no color choice, no buy: I want a specific color, not a random one. Color selection. Locking Earring Case: I want to buy this product, but I want it in Black. Folks. Poor option: Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!. NOT WATER PROOF: Don\\'t waste your money buying this tent. Hands-Down Yello\\'s Finest Album: I\\'ve been a Yello fan since Solid Pleasure\\'s release and I\\'ve experience the best (One Second, Claro Que Si) and worst (Zebra) of what this group has to offer. The album divine: This album is the best of Yello\\'s earliest albums. Unevenly Fantastic: This album has some of the most fascinating,bizarre sound at some points and other songs are flat out boring. One second, Forever: Great tunes dripping with latin up beat melodies and smooth syncopation. One of the most innovative Cd\\'s of all time. Hypnotic sounds abound on this great Yello CD: This is one of my favourite Yello albums. delivery review: This delivery does not have the most up-to-date photography but they are good enough and the general sentiment and prose are very nice. Know what is happening inside you: Pregnancy can be a very long wait. 1962 version bothered me: I have several fetal development deliverys now, but this one is the only one I couldn\\'t stand to keep. Great delivery - A must for every pregnant woman!: This is the same delivery I looked at every week when I was pregnant, and now my granddaughter is using it! Awesome!. I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back. A bit disappointed: While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the delivery in general. Another masterwork: Jerry Goldsmith created soundscapes that sometimes surpassed the films they were got for in evoking emotions and revealing character. Logan\\'s Run-Limited Edition: I\\'ve always been a fan of film scores, and I\\'ve wanted this one on CD for a long time. Wonderful soundtrack: This soundtrack is amazing. Informative and entertaining to got: For the fact that the delivery was got just a few years after Li\\'s death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. Lacking: This delivery lacks the depth it seems to promise. Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative: The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. too old: got in 1970\\'s it\\'s really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Invaluable: The chapters on \"Genuine Encounter\" and \"I-Messages\" are worth goting again and again. Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population: Avoid this delivery on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is \"related to a failure in identification\" and that parents of homosexual children should \"seek professional help at the earliest possible moment\". FORGET PAGE 144: I have got this delivery and it offers excellent advise for parents. Good: It was a good delivery with a good lesson.

Doubtful. manon -Not in his own words by a long shot: Nuel Emmons, ex-con, aspiring journalist and two-faced acquaintance of Charlie, covers no new ground in this delivery. I don\\'t believe manon had anything to do with this. totally untrue: \"Charles manon in Nuell Emmons\\'s Words\" anyone who\\'s seen or heard manon interviewed, knows his lingo and knows those aren\\'t his words. Most Dangerous Man Alive. Fabrication. FICTION? I THINK NOT: I HAVE got ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE product OF manON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY. WHAT???

Great Ep: this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. huh?: Why would I choose to listen to this when I algoty own every Black Sabbath album, and every Blue Chear album? I mean-it sounds like a cover band pretty much. CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT: I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of \"NJMOM\\'s Review\" above. One of the Top Ten for any Gnostic Library: THE SECRET deliveryS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from \"New Age\" claptrap & commercialist distortion.

Smoked some bud too no doubt!! hehe. Art of Dali: I liked the delivery. Everything You Want From Dali and More: This delivery is the definitive look at Dali. excellent: in addition to providing many details about Dali\\'s life, his relationship with Breton and the surrealists, his friendship with Picasso and so on, the delivery provides the goter with an excellent discussion/analysis/explanation of Dali\\'s artistic/aesthetic choices and of his \\'paranoiac-critical method\\'.

Don\\'t waste your money!: This was a real disappointment. Please Don\\'t Buy this Toy: My son loves Batman and was looking forward to playing with this toy. Might be OK if your child is older: My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. I\\'ve been had!: This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. What a waste!: This toy is a disaster. worst toy ever: I bought this toy for my 4 year old for Christmas and all you have to do is touch it and the pieces fall off. This toy is not worth the money: I sure wish I would have got the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn\\'t believe how flimsy this toy is. Fun if you can get it to stand up for any lenght of time: This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Batcave a good buy!: My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. Catastrophe Cave!: The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son\\'s birthday. Great idea, poorly engineered: Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I\\'d like to know. DO NOT BOTHER: This is toy so frustrating. Imagination at its BEST!: Yes, this item may be a little tippy. WORST TOY EVER!: After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. Fun, But Falls Apart: I bought this toy for my son\\'s fourth birthday in September. Batcave - get in touch with mattel: Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster. BATMAN TOYS NEEDS BETTER QUALITY: I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. Very Disappointed . Waste of money: Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic. Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave: Do not buy this toy. JUNK: MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. Batcave Warning!!! Caution!!!: WARNING!!! CAUTION!!! Parents do not waste your hard earned money or valuable time with this toy.

Mattel + Batman = JUNK TOYS!: Just \"assembled\" the bat cave for my 5 year old.

POOR QUALITY: I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I\\'ve purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. Don\\'t Buy The Batcave: My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. Flimsy. Save Your Money: I have previously purchased a Ross Berstein delivery (\"Gopher Hockey by the Hockey Gopher\") and found that to be an entertaining got. I wish it were a better delivery: In the delivery,  Company Bernstein notes that he writes 5 deliverys a year. Thrilled! And Warm!: I bought this to help heat a bath off my master bedroom. Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate: My review title pretty much says it all. Unacceptable: The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. Keep looking if you want a portable mixer: I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. 10 Channel Mixer: I bought this mixer for my husband off his wish list. What\\'s not to like?: Easy to got yet scholarly. take a different class: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the  Companys, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. Attempts at Classification: I\\'m not sold on social psychology. waste of money: the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. Outstanding delivery: From the persective of a U. clifford: this is a very good delivery for the younger goters. Clifford\\'s Halloween: He\\'s our favorite dog to got about! Any delivery about Clifford is a hit with my 3. might be a good scanner: my scanner hasn\\'t worked since the day i took it out of the box, installed the software, and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing! looks like it\\'s a dud. Crap, Crap, Crap!!!: There is no other way to put it. Don\\'t buy this scanner: I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notedelivery\\'s USB port. Do Not Buy This Scanner: Absolutely the worst software for flatbed scanner I have ever encountered. Intentional Obsolescence -- 2011 and it still no drivers!: Vista has been out for 4 years, I\\'m up to Windows 7, and they still haven\\'t released a driver update for this scanner!This is what\\'s called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. It doesnt work with Vista: The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. Save yourself the trouble: I\\'m pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Don\\'t buy this scanner: I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. Forget The Hype! This is a Great Record!: Forget that Capitol records killed this band\\'s career by letting the public believe that Klaatu was the Beatles secretly reunited (shame on them)! Forget that the name of this band was taken from a Sci-Fi Product (Like Duran Duran didn\\'t do the same?)! Forget that The Carpenters covered thier best known song! Just forget all that junk, and LISTEN TO THE RECORD! YES! LISTEN! This band should have been BIG! It\\'s sad that they only gained a cult following. real life hero: just as good now as when i bought the album when it first came out. Klaatu: It was a replacement for the one that was \"stolen\" by my now \"ex\" about ten years ago. Beatle mutation music at it\\'s pop cosmic best!: \"Subrosa Subway\" hooked me right in. HELL\\'S Yeah!: This live recording of Incantation IS a must own. Small and mighty. Terrible Picture Quality: Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. Growing Up Elsewhere: A former \"diplobrat\" who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden\\'s description of a child\\'s first encounter with France. Did not like: Just not my type of delivery. Just what I wanted: Thanks for providing me with an oldie but goodie. Fine for children, boring for adults: One has to be a young adult to enjoy this delivery. Does not work for Ipod connectivity on PC\\'s: Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed.

Not G5 Compatible: Though the description states this card will work with G3 and above it wont even fit in the PCI slot for a G5 1. Bad quality: Installation and use was easy and good. good value, works like a charm!: This card installed without a hitch on my Dell Dimension with Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2). Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair: I\\'ve had this card installed since Nov. Does not work with PowerMac G5: Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher, this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5. Rockin\\' In Rhythm. Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. not immoral: this delivery is surely one of the best. Truly and excellent delivery. A wonderful tale!: This is a magnificent delivery. Not for those looking for an uplifting got. Much more action oriented than other Clavell work. Clavell has done it again. A significant change from Noble House Saga: A very good got, this novel is more \"complex\" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. Not all that profound after all: I had got this delivery over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. Disapointing: After Shogun one would expect much better. gots like a delivery for 8 to 12 year olds: I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. Couldn\\'t get into it. king rat: the delivery is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the delivery as I am goting it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl. A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the goter with his insight to the human condition. An unforgettable journey!: In my honest opinion, this was one of the best deliverys I have ever got. Great delivery and Series: Great delivery and Series. Great delivery if you are into WWII hiproduct of the Pacific: After living in Singapore for seven years, I got a lot on the war in the pacific. Outstanding!: If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this delivery is a must. Really liked the delivery: When I first got the delivery a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a Product It\\'s been at least 30 years since I first got it. Disappointing: This is the 4th Clavell delivery I\\'ve got, I was more than a little disappointed. below par: after goting all of clavell\\'s deliverys, i was looking forward to King Rat. Quick, interesting, and accurate: This is different from the \"Asian Saga\" deliverys. Numbers Peg puzzle: This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child\\'s age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background. My son loves it!: My son learned his numbers so quickly with the help of this puzzle. Great buy!: You cant go wrong with these puzzles! My son loves to play with them and discover whats under the puzzle pieces. Colorful, durable AND educational!: I bought this for my great nephew - 18 months old who is algoty learning to count and learn his colors. cute: My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this puzzle. Best \"Toy\" Ever!: My 16 month old has been playing with this off and on for about a month, and she can now put every single number in the correct place every time without a second of hesitation! Because the numbers are got below each space, she now even recognizes the WORD for each number! Am I ordering the alphabet puzzle immediately. Numbers Puzzle: I bought this puzzle for my son because we can\\'t afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC\\'s, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I love these puzzles. Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. GREAT NUMBER BOARD: Our son plays with this board while I\\'m feeding him. Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look: 1. Excellent for my students: I teach mentally handicapped adults at a local community college, and if you want durable puzzles that your students can use over and over again, I strongly recommend getting puzzles like this. Great Teaching Tool: This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers. purchased for 2 yr. 5 FOR ESTATE, 3 FOR THE REST: IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEW, I AM THE ONE THAT LEFT A COMMENT IN FAVOR, BUT WONDERING WHY THEY LEFT ONLY ONE STAR. Summer-Estate: Anyone who hears this song and isn\\'t mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. Question: Why does it look as though the same person wrote all seven of the reviews above? Kind of odd, huh?. A waste of time: This delivery does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin\\'s music. Amazon needs to sort out Weinstock and Huneker: This delivery is listed with Weinstock as the  Company, but Huneker is the  Company. Not what expected: As a Noni user for many years, when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni. Simple, clear and solidly dogmatic: This is a traditional Catholic study guide delivery of the Mass of the Angels. Pure genius!: This is the one of the few deliverys of poetry I\\'ve got that actually means something! Discovering this has really changed the way I think about verse and deliverys in general. If you like Douglass, you\\'ll like this: Good stuff from the great freedom fighter. Frontin\\': Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. MAD HOT FRIED BLOCK PARTY-TYPE MUSIC: THIS BE HOT! NOBODY CAN TOUCH PHARRELL! THIS BE HOT! I\\'VE ONLY HEARD \"FRONTIN\\'\" THOW. It\\'s not the greatest song: I love the neptunes and almost everything done by them has struck me as gold, but this song is not that great. The Return of Randy Watson:\"Sexual Chocolate\": I\\'ll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now. great insights into a world that few ever see: fantastic investigative reporting with compelling analysis. no product: I am unable to review this product as the item NEVER arrived and I ended up with a refund. Best introduction to its subject that I know of: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. A great delivery~: This delivery has great myths. Informational: This delivery is a great resource delivery. Great delivery - a good introduction to Greek mythology: I purchased this delivery for my 9 year old son as a companion delivery to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. Children like this delivery: My children (ages 5-10) love this delivery. A early favorite: Greek Gods and Heroes is one of the better deliverys on mythology for children out thare, with great pictures and easy to understand stories that people of all ages can enjoy. Incorrect and Misleading: Attention! Sheldon\\'s views of Jefferson\\'s thought to not reflect on Jefferson\\'s! I could not believe what I was goting when I opened up this delivery. POOR QUALITY: THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS. Disappointed !: As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. Second 510 purchased in two years; both are excellent: I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment: I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. ripped-off by seller: American Electronics Mart sold me a \"refurbished\" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. DocuMate 510 is Horrible: This scanner is absolutely terrible. ALL Delivary man are titled left: I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. JUNK - don\\'t waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. worked well, but now driver issues: This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. Not great, but not bad: Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. Good scanner - poor software: Don\\'t buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. Stinks jams all the time: Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. Compatible ONLY with their software: Bad Scanner. worst scanner ever: I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible. Love Die Happy!: Just to beware, this single does not have a B side to it. intersting: This delivery has opend up my eyes. Educational toy: This is a very effective toy. Get This Player!: Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. Good for a little while, but. **Great player, but but for newbies**: I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. Zen: I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. Good Unit: I\\'ve algoty dropped it, (unit was off) and it\\'s fine. First and Last: This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. lacking file format support is not for me: this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don\\'t support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me. What\\'s with the low sound?: I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. BASIC DESIGN FLAW: Forget how this unit works because it has a basic design flaw that will drive users crazy! The front cover has a release button that allows removal of the front cover to access the removable battery. Headphone Jack Problems: The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven\\'t they recalled all Zen\\'s?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2. A Possible Discontinued Item?: What\\'s going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is \"sold out\" or more likely \"discontinued\" at the almighty Amazon. Great MP3 player: Where to start I have had this for 10 years and it is still ticking that alone is a tesament to how well the thing works. Headphone jack: I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. Steer clear of all Creative MP3 players: I love my Zen Xtra 40GB - well at least I loved my Xtra. Solid Player without the \"iPod Mystique\": I purchased this player over 4 months ago. Doing the job for less money!!!!: If you want space to carry your music everywhere. Not a fan: I took my zen back after a week of problems. THIS PLAYER IS TRASH !: The price looks good do not be fooled. Phone Jack Faulty: I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase. Good for the price: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. What a great toy!: I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. breaks easily and has bad warrenty: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. What a junk: What a junk. Why can\\'t it be rated ZERO stars?: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nice portable, small GPS receiver!: I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. Junk!! Yosemite is not POI according Navteq: Can you imagine. Angel Baby: I ordered this video and it took nearly a month to arrive because it was being shipped from England. Perfect for Every Fisherman: Beautiful and very helpful delivery for both the experienced and novice fishermen. disappointed: I can\\'t share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers. This is rubbish: If you\\'re a Heaven 17 fan, you\\'re gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you\\'re gonna be disappointed. Detox pretty damn good. Many Flaws in Mellor\\'s \\'Nursery Knits\\': This delivery\\'s patterns are seriously flawed. fun, funky patterns: I bought this delivery after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that delivery. Bought 4 of these. THE classic jazz Christmas \\'album\\': This is the classic jazz Christmas Album--from before there were dozens of copy-cat collections. Tired of the same ole at Christmas? This classic will inspire you!: Of course, I grew up listening to this Ramsey Lewis collection through my open bedroom door as my parents decorated the house to make way for the magic of Christmas that was to come~so these Sounds of Christmas are intimately woven into those fondest memories of childhood. Nice Jazz Xmas. Ramsey\\'s Best: I remember this recording from my teen years. Ericsson Vehicle Hands-Free Solution HF 7600: I have bought 2 of these items for my 2 cars, but it burns the batteries every time! It even burns the phone, sometimes. Have not got, but know for fact. Tallant\\'s \"creative\" talent: Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either \"Voodoo\" or New Orleans, you probably should got. Lousy delivery!: I searched all over to find a delivery specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find. Old and Silly: This is strictly a tourist rag. If you want to know about New Orleans Voodoo, avoid this rag: If you are interested in goting a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this delivery. Very technical and complex: This delivery is very detailed, technical and complex. M. Fascinating look into economics, still seen as legendary: This fascinating look into the world of developing and growing economies emphasises the LCD\\'s inverted \"u\" shaped curve of Economic growth. pretty good: The set-up was a little weird and random but the writing was excellent. What happens when squares come to the Quarter?: Wow! It\\'s like they transplanted someone from Kansas to the epitone of hip cities. A very important delivery: This is a powerful delivery. must got for anyone interested in sudan: I found this delivery enlightening not knowing anything about the current sitaution in sudan other than bits and pieces in the news. Great got!!!!: Shows how the product of one man can make a difference. Slavery Still Exists: Excellent delivery. Great stuff behind a ridiculous title. pretty good documentary: overall, the documentary was pretty cool. beach boys and the satan: a totally off and enjoyable Product.

DON\\'T BUY THIS ONE!: I purchased this product just a few months ago and it\\'s broken algoty. Okay: This is an okay player. Not so great: This is NOT Koss at its best. DON\\'T BUY THIS: OK, people, all I have to say is this thing sux. somewhat crappy: of course you can\\'t expect the ps2 experience to translate to the psp. this game has it all: though the series nba street never seems to change, the game it self is real fun. Great Graphics But NO GAMEPLAY and BAD CONTROLING: When I got these review I thought this game was going to be amazing but no one mentioned that this game has very bad Controling. Not worth your money: They should have called this product lemon vaseline. Greasy Grapefruit!: A sugar and oil mix with an explosive citrus fragrance.

Value is the issue here: Yes, this isn\\'t the best space heater I have ever owned, but it has a unique shape where it doesn\\'t gather a bunch of dust, like past heaters have, and you can\\'t beat the price for its performance. THIS THING SUCKS: Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.

Semi- additive Cooking: Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients . Barely edible: I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this delivery that were edible. Don\\'t be fooled by these deliverys,: just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. Rip Off of previous delivery: I\\'m so mad! I got this supposedly \"new\" Cookdelivery and when it came it looked identicall to the first cookdelivery expcept her picture on the front is different!

Call the doctor!: Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes. Producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time: Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time. Not a practical delivery: This oversized delivery does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages. Do Not Buy This delivery: I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. What took me so long?!: Why did I wait so long to get this delivery I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography. Advertising: It is one brand name after another, don\\'t waste your money. Outdated algoty!: I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use. WHAT is the point of this show???: Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does \"cooking. Help for the holidays: With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this delivery I knew it was just what I needed.

This delivery Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn\\'t kidding when he writes on the very first page \"The product You Are About To got Will Scare The Hell Out Of You\". Wonderful delivery: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the manon Family for the August 1969 murders. Super Scary and Fascinating: Charles manon is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the product. Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil. kindle edition warning . Helter Skelter: I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. Amazing. The plague that this delivery has caused. Too bad the delivery is completely fiction. Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Product: I realize that this is the first delivery a person will come to when searching on manON. the classic pulp novel is still selling fast: Bugliosi\\'s ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. Helter Smelter: Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles manon. Gratuitous slasher porn: In this decade of fear, the drama of the manon family murders is making a comeback. Helter Skelter: The DA\\'s own fabrication: This product is not the true product of the murders, but the concoction of VB. Blood Fest 1969: The chilling product as told by detective Bugliosi will scare and shock you to your utmost. Great got: This is a great delivery so far.

Helter Skelter The manon Murders: while this delivery is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. Some interesting moments. Kindle version of this delivery is NOT coimplete: Amazon won\\'t tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. great and insghtful: well got and informative. Most interesting: This delivery by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best delivery I have ever got. Surprisingly Witty!: I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry got. Bugliosi Brings Out manon\\'s True Darkness: Helter Skelter is one of those deliverys that leave you in dismay because you can\\'t believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. DAWN\\'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER: Helter Skelter is a very interesting delivery. Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious: I Thought that the delivery Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true manon crimes. What else can I say? The definitive telling of the manon murders. Real Life Horror product: This delivery is not for everyone. Good for the product itself, not the writing: This delivery is endlessly fascinating because the manon product is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. got MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!: This is the best true-crime delivery ever got, imho. bad delivery: it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole manon murders. This is NOT the true product of the manon Murders!!!: This delivery is well got and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. A masterpiece of cool jazz, funk and classical music: I just love this album. extremely dull: I will admit, I had to got this for class, but I couldn\\'t have been more bored.

Excelent: Very interesting got, if you love hiproduct you will love this delivery as I did. Good delivery: A historical romance from the 1700\\'s that tells of the true massacre of the French by the Natchez Indians. too long and boring got: This delivery is too long and the product too convoluted to be enjoyable. Impossible: This set was so complicated that we are returning it. would be good if only there were directions: This kit has a building diagram for only 1 project and that diagram was so poor that my husband who played with these kkits as a kid in the 60s (yes they have been around that long) couldn\\'t easily figure it out - and he rarely has trouble figuring out anything. Impossible to use: I bought this for my 10 year-old son. Older kids like it. excellent rollator/walker: This is a very good rollator.

Set of four Free standing card holders: Haven\\'t had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I\\'m sure they will be just fine and work as expected. Great for arthritic hands: I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it\\'s difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. Great for arthritic hands!: These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. expensive but well worth it. Very Handy: I play Hand and Foot every other week and the four of us love using these. Don\\'t buy: What ever you do don\\'t buy this product. Watch the price: I bought this from the same co. war of the warewolf: Greenberg and Tuccille have got an old fachoned lycanthropic thriller with some amusing political undertones. Works Great: The biggest minus is having to remove the phone from the cradle and unplug the cord from the phone to remove from the car. OOPS! WRONG delivery!!: This delivery gots like a dervative of a badly got derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of \"Dark and Stormy Night. Pass On This One: For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. All foam - no beer: I usually like Flint and have got everything he published. put it down after a few chapters: Well I\\'m not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. Too wordy. Great product!: Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome Product go SA!!!. Great value - now: These once cost nearly $3000, but I got my z557 for about 1/15th of that.

Yesteryear: I have got this delivery several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I got it. Great Science Fiction: I got deliverys for \"escapism\" and for the pleasure of goting. This delivery could have been good. A delivery to got again and again: A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this delivery. Do not buy. Poor Design, Construction & Quality: We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One hundred stars. Pretty entertaining: Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. Wings Above the Diamantina: If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one. A must have for your CD collection!: This is a great CD! Ten originals along with excellent remakes of \"Some Kind of Wonderful\" and \"I Can\\'t Hold Hold Out\", both of which the band has molded into their own while keeping true to the original. Jabra EarGels: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. Not worth the $2. Glad they were under ten bucks. Hardly worth the whole $2. Good Deal: Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Jabra Eargels: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. the keep my icon and my jabra extreme where they belong. Completely Worthless: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they\\'re worthless. Jabra ear gel: Product works perfectly with jawbone 2. Junk,Don\\'t wast your money. Jabra EarGels: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. Makes a Jawbone 2 better: I hated the fit of my Jawbone 2. great product: people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential. THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS. POOR: GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. Great Item: I am very happy with this product. Preset sizes just don\\'t fit: The title says it all. Didn\\'t fit: Although good quality product, it doesn\\'t fit my ear at all. Doesn\\'t fit well at all, hard to get into ear. Not for my application: I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. You only need 1 size: I cannot find where to buy my size and which ear I use my eargel. Not a trustworthy company: I bought two sets of these. Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the \"flap\" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. waste of money: Absolute waste of money. didn\\'t fit my ears: Complete waste of money. Way too large!: Well I took a chance on these. To Big: These were way to big for my ears. excellent vendor: eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. Great for a few weeks: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Not compatible with Jawbone Icon: With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. Terrible design: I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. Ear Gels: None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. Much needed: I bought these to go with the Jawbone 2 because the ear piece they use will not stay in your ear and the loops that go over your ear just does not fit. Jabra Eargels Great Help for my Jawbone II: While I loved the sound of my Jawbone II headset, it would not remain secured with the eargels provided. Solid upgrade for Jawbone: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Not for me. Worthless: None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered. How is this supposed to work?: I got these for my jawbone headset. Not Recommended: I only have one word to say about it. So much better than \"over the ear\": I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. Fits perfectly on my Jawbone headset: I\\'m using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. bad fit, way too big: Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears. Waste of money: This product ended up being a waste of money for me. Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe: In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I can hear!: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. don\\'t buy: these were advertised to fit the habra stone. Waste of money: These ear gels were supposed to fit easily on the Jabra Bluetooth that I have, but they don\\'t stay on at all once they were placed on it. Total Waste of Money: Not one of the ear gels worked. Does not fit jawbone 2 very well: I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. not compatable with the jawbone. They fit nicely in the ear, but don\\'t work so well with jawbone: I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Works well with the Samsung WEP200: I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn\\'t get them to stay in. Works well and comfortably. Instructions on how to use with Jawbone: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won\\'t stay on very well. I need two sizes!: I love these eargels. Jabra Ear Gels: I ordered the ear gels to go with my Jawbone Bluetooth headset. Jabra Ear Gels: a comfortable and economical alternative for earhook type Bluetooth headsets. Stick it in your ear!: I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. Liked the ear piece: I quess I ordered the wrong ones, did not fit my ear piece well. BULK PACKAGING: These came in a tiny ziploc bag with no retail label. Thanks for nothing, Jabra: Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. useless: For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. Far from perfect. Does not fit Jawbone Era: The specs for this product state that it universally fits all Jawbone headsets. Eargels for Jawbone retrofit: Using the Jabra eargels over my Jawbone. Good: I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well. These are not the answer to Jawbone Noise Asason: While Jawbone make a great blue tooth ear bud, it doesn\\'t interface with ears well. GREAT: The Jabra Eargels are wonderful. These don\\'t work with Jabra BT250v headsets: I\\'m not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it\\'d be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don\\'t fit these headsets. Jabra clear gel - useless: These were said to work great with the Jawbone blue tooth headset. Very good. Old and yellowed: Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. Ripoff ! Don\\'t Buy From CMMA Accessories !: I received these and they were defective. Good solution for people with weird shaped ears. Very functional, not very pretty: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn\\'t get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. It\\'s a keeper!: I first looked through this cookdelivery in another lady\\'s kitchen. Great effects. Poor excuse for a great product: I watched this Product this year after I got the delivery. Mythological Fiction: This film is one of the better of this genre--due to the casting, and the more \"true to life and literature\" approach that is taken. Oh boy. absolutely HORRIBLE: I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a Product before. Cmon \"honors\" people!: the Product was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. Excellent, Exhilirating, and Fun: And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days. Great translation from print to screen! Worth buying a copy: It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. WOW: Watching this Product after having got the delivery is pretty much hell. Uhh. Uggh: Yes, yes the Product was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. Mullets across the Med: I don\\'t see why the producers bothered making this Product. More like a NEGATIVE 3: This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. I agree: I totally agree with andrew. coulda been betta!!!!!!!!: the special effects sucked and we\\'ve seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of Products we\\'ve seen it was pretty crap. Blech: This Product was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with Products. Still compelling after 3000 years. adventurous. kewl!: The Product the Odessey was a very very good Product. THIS WAS THE BEST Product EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i\\'ve ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this Product than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too. Ouch! This Product was so bad, it was funny: Everything about this Product was baaadddd. Odyssey (VHS): I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. Agonizingly Long: Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this Product was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. Product is awesome. The odyssey: I thought that the Odyssey was a very good Product. Reasonable interpretation of a classic: When you start with such good material, it\\'s hard to please everyone. Good: I saw this Product for first time having missed it when it first aired. Great delivery; terrible Product: if you have got and liked the delivery, or know anything about the product, this Product would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. Homer\\'s enchanting tale: Homer\\'s enchanting tale is brought to life in \"The Odyssey. Great for the classroom: This video is great to use as a resource for teaching The Odyssey. Good: I loved this Product! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. NOT a good representation of Homer: I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this Product does NOT reflect the delivery well, if you\\'re watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the Product is out of sequence) just because my students think it\\'s fun. Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century: It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. OMG! worst Product ever!: haha . Lord, have mercy!: If this Product were worse (and if it COULD be) there would undoubtedly be an unhealthy number of premature deaths . Awful, just awful: Armand Assante is one of the worst delivary man I have ever had the misfortune to watch. Who be dissin on our noteboom?: Ok, first of all Mr. Falwed but Fun none the less: I love Greek Hiproduct and mythology. Out of date, but good: _Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe\\'s attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. The ONLY translation of Schure\\'s play. My son loves it: Great language, humor and wonderful product telling are hallmarksof Gerald Durrell\\'s deliverys. My family and other animals: I got Gerald Durrell\\'s deliverys 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. works great: This mold is great for what I need. Can\\'t get worse: This delivery is bad (period). Nauseating: In a phrase: as nauseating as the \"artwork\" which besmirches its cover. The Coolest: I wore this shirt to work one Friday (casual day) and one the my co-workers told me \"I\\'ve worked here 7 years and that is the coolest shirt I\\'ve ever seen. Two fro the price of one: This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. Excellent Product: This has been really helpful for maintaining protein levels after my surgery. Bad memory leakes: The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. ORIGINAL SURF MUSIC FROMTHE 60\\'S: THE IMPACTS WERE ANOTHER SOCAL SURF BAND FROM THE EARLY 60\\'S THAT USED TO PLAY AT THE BALBOA BALLROOM ALONG WITH A LOT OF OTHER GREAT BANDS FROM THAT TIME (DICK DALE AND THE DEL-TONES, THE CROSSFIRES, SENTINALS, TORNADOS, AND A LOT OF OTHER ONES AS WELL. RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris: Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will got the real product. Mirror came damaged and late: After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. dont buy from them: They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. below average: I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Good Concert: Always been a Cocker fan and this one will not disappoint. Good DVD: Enjoyed it immensely. great show, worth buying: Great audio and video with many hits. Useful: Needed for class. Bait & Switch - Completely misleading picture: I too got taken in by the \"coiled\" picture. This is a keeper for sure: I have personally used this edition of the Psalms for quite a while. rated comparatively with Wilbur\\'s others: i have got all of Wilbur\\'s deliverys and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). The Diamond Hunters: This delivery is one of Wilbur Smith\\'s early deliverys and it shows. The Diamond Hunters: Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. The Diamaond Hunters: When I order a delivery I expect a delivery 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. Totally Unbelievable Tale: This delivery falls in the bottom five of the 28 deliverys that I have got by Wilbur Smith. Less than Smith is capable of doing. Love Wilbur Smith: What a great writer. Poorly Made: What a disappointment. Dangerous Mail Service: So often we see in westerns the stagecoach roaring into town and well-dressed easterners get out--not even dusty. Very Action packed and cool: I like this Product. In good condition: Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape . I was rooting for the whale in this one: Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. 1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles: So disappointing! How could a Product made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that\\'s where the compliments end. Why is Fedellah Asian?: I love the delivery, Moby Dick. Overall, an excellent Product. Highly entertaining: I guess I\\'m in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. A pitiful excuse for a Product: If you want to see a Product of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. Moby Dick: Product was great but the sub-titles were \"off\" and distracting (but hilarious at times!) Just finished goting the delivery, and the Product was pretty acurate. Patrick Stewart and the 7 Dwarfs: Boy, what a lousy Moby Dick! Patrick Stewart is terrific. Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!: Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Products that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,product and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this Product! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!. TERRIBLE Product: What a waste of 2 hours. awesome: I thought Patrick Stewart did a fantastic job. Classics never die!: If your looking for a different version of the classic \"Moby Dick\" then fine. Simply awful: I know its very hard to bring a delivery like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950\\'s. Round Perditions Flames: I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Weak remake: I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. DON\\'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM,SEE THE HOUSTON 1956 ONE!: Between lousy directing, and pointless wide camera angles, and a total disreagard to the delivery, (Unlike previous film and TV episodics) this was so bad, that I forced myself to sit through the entire video, just to see if it ever got better, or resembled the delivery in any way. DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION: It seems that there are several different versions of this TV Product available. strong smell of oil: This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. Favorably impressed!: This little heater works far better than I\\'d hoped. Long term owner: Had this for 3 years. good heat, cheap wheels: I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). Poor Product: This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting. Pretty Corny: I\\'ve got several other Deborah Smith deliverys. One of the best from Deborah Smith: I have enjoyed a few deliverys from this  Company, but this one, was one of my favorites. Deborah Smith: got her, you will enjoy your time with her characters. Great delivery: This delivery is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader. review by Tarek musslimani: This is an absolutely not useful delivery. excellent delivery: In my opinion is one of the best introductory delivery in statistical thermodynamics. A nice companion to McQuarrie\\'s text: I thought this was a terriable delivery by itself, but makes for a nice companion when goting through McQuarrie\\'s delivery. No better place to start with Stat Mech: If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. great handdelivery: i\\'m a student of applied chemistry and this delivery has everything you need too know as undergraduate of statistical thermodynamics. Don\\'t Bother: Don\\'t bother. Dgotful. A disappointment: Having heard the  Company speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Not my cup of tea: This was the first Anne Perry delivery I have got, but it will be the last. Perry is now two times as classy!: William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. This was the slowest and most non-action, action Product ever. Sho and Jean are good together: When I first saw this Product had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it. Boring. Van Damme gives the best performance,: which does not bode well for the Product. worst action Product ever: Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. Van Damme\\'s a Bad Guy ?: I would say the plot is good, but the action and fighting scenes are not in favour for action-Product goers. Where did the producers put all the money in Black Eagle?: First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this Product is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting: Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I\\'m not a big Van Damme fan. Little dated, but great: Zaller turns our perception of polling data on its ear. Didn\\'t work. Flea control: This is a great product and I have used it for years. create your own flea circus: I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. good product: Its an ok value for the money, would buy from amazon again in the future. Adequate: The springs on this hanger are a bit tight. Blues-psych, somewhat like Cream: 1969 blues-psych. Great Acid Rock!: Haven\\'t purchased this, but having listened to the whole album, I sure will!. SOLID METAL!!: Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it\\'s brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. A charismatic Lutheran who\\'s more charismatic than Lutheran: This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidedelivery for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. Great Cards: This is an amazing deck of cards. great for the price: Bought this for my husband for christmas. would be 4. Plano Compact Bow Case: For the price its an excellent bow case. Excellent: The delivery which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking delivery by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. Great latin disco: I have only gotten interested in disco in the last few years, but now I am a huge fan. Not quite Gone with the Wind. Wonderful!: I first got this delivery in 1962. inside not as good as the cover: The cover of this delivery makes the masks look intricate and impressive. A delivery that long? Are you kidding me?: Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this delivery. Weak: This delivery was disappointing. Sad: Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite  Companys. It drags: I tried a couple of times to got this delivery. Mercedes wrote this?: I\\'ve been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. Dishonest!: A large part of this delivery has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C. Alternate Italian Renaissance Light Hiproduct: Any delivery set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. JUST GREAT: So it was long, and it was a slow got, big DEAL. Ok at best: I didn\\'t make it half way through the delivery before I gave up on it. This delivery has algoty been got: Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I\\'ll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C. Too many cooks: The delivery had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. This is Merovingian Nights ,not a new delivery: mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. Fantastic!: Fantastic delivery! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This delivery is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. Tells of a Venice where magic is alive: Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint & Dave Freer\\'s Shadow Of The Lion is set in 1537 and tells of a Venice where magic is alive and two vagabond brothers are posed to influence its changes. an OK got, but not what I expected: I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have got nearly all her deliverys, and this delivery is by far, my LEAST favorite. Wonderful delivery: I love this delivery, it has different kinds of projects that you\\'ll enjoy, and the charts are neat, I love it!!!!!!. Disappointing: Over the years I\\'ve bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I\\'ve listened to with great enjoyment. Unheard talent: Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their \"Heart Of The Ages\" album at the same time. Keeping Irelands Hiproduct Alive Through Song: This CD captures the essence of how the Irish Soldier, during the War Between The States, passed on their hiproduct from Ireland. A couple of positives. This is a bad one: This is a really bad Product. Terrible: Typical Hollywood Product trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. Under the tuscan sun: to be honest I expected a little more from the Product. leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this Product at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this Product. A great idea!: Hey gang, let\\'s pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I\\'m telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. Stinks: This Product was terrible. Disappointing: Having got Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this Product was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful product became a run of the mill chick flick. Very Uplifting and Fun: I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Heart warming Product: I saw the Product last night in a preview showing. YAWN!: I eagerly anticipated watching this Product, as I thoroughly enjoyed the delivery; however, the Product shares only a passing resemblance to the delivery. Does not follow the delivery much. Enjoyable escapism: Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Product night: Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE productline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this Product. The delivery is WAY Better. Terrible stinker!: What a stupid Product! There was nothign admirable in the main character. Good Product: I love the full screen edition of the Product. Couldn\\'t Watch: I have been looking for this Product for a long while. A Very Pleasant product: Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven Product. Feel Good Product: Absolutely loved this Product. If you got the delivery, don\\'t watch the Product!: I really enjoyed this delivery, but I was very disappointed by the Product. If you liked the delivery, you will not like this film. The biggest surprise of the year! This film is a marvel!: We\\'ll I\\'m not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Guys miss this one: Gentlemen miss this Product. One of the best chick flicks ever: Diane Lane is perfect. Relationships in Tuscany: This is a lovely Product set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. Quite a change from the delivery: Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Beautiful People. Very charming warm Product on a cold winter Saturday afternoon: This Product is very warm toned and sincere. Great Product: My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Great Product for you and your gal friends to watch together!: Pop the popcorn. Enjoyable & Light: When I go to the Products, I go to relax and enjoy a break from everday life. Boring!!!: This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. Charming surprise. Opposing View of Divorce: The heart break and loss from a woman point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Undercover?: I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T. Good flick: Yes i\\'m a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me. Boring: This Product was very boring and hard to get into. Are you KIDDING ME????: Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller delivery to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. Boring, Drawn Out Product: I watched the Product before goting the delivery. Magnificent Product! Diane Lane shines!: A truly magnificent Product. Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining: Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film. Stupid Product: I was extremely disappointed with this Product. If it was not for Diane Lane. Tuscany steals the show: This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up. Diane Lane feast. Ho-Hum: One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. barely cosi cosi (so so): This might be an ok Product to watch on a weekend when you\\'re bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Cute but typical: So-so at it\\'s best. Great Product!: Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable Product. Horrible Product!!!: I absolutely HATED this Product. not worthy to be a chick flick: First, this Product has nothing to do whatsoever with the delivery except for the title. Gutless garbage: \"Under The Tuscan Sun\": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE\\' ABORE\\': Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the Product itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Trite, weak, thin, fake, demeaning,: The product is probably a wonderful love product; but, to get there you must suffer through the paper-thin character of a woman with no depth, no self, no mind. Families / Christians BEWARE: I rented this Product thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean Product that I could enjoy watching. Horrible Product!!!: I absolutely HATED this Product. Good Fun?: This is a fun Product if you like the romantic comedy. A Woman finds herself in Italy: Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed. Is this really a \\'chick flick\\'??????: I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy. IS OK. Not Bad. Under the Tuscan Sun: If you like romantic Products, this is the perfect one for you. Diane Lane and Under The Tuscan Sun: This is a good Product. Uplifting and Beautiful: The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring. OH MY GOD!: One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this Product with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment. Make Sure the Format is in Your Region: I\\'m such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. Lightweight but enjoyable: A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the Product, and to be honest, that\\'s a fair critique. For MEN only: maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. Under the Tuscan Sun: This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a Product I have seen in a long time. Boooring. It was pretty good, but could have been better. A really fun, smart and sexy Product!: This was a GREAT and FUN Product. The most entertaining film of the year: This Product was so entertaining. wrong formAt: I may have got the description wong but the DVD won\\'t play. Beautiful product!: This Product is based loosely on the true product of France Mayes. delightful and quirky: I enjoyed this Product thoroughly. Beautiful scenery, but thats about all: Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a Product to show off a pretty face. Dismal: I hated this dismal Product. Non vero Italia!: This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. If you liked this Product, you might have a brain damage: Easily, the worst film of the year. Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century?: I should have got the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. Terrible Product, Great scenery: From the onset, this Product was stilted and poorly developed. Great Blu Ray Presentation: Didn\\'t see the BD review on Blu-ray. Propoganda: This is another Product in the long line of Products trying to shove homosexuality down our throats. BORING!!!: I rented this Product while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. Cliche city, what was Diane Lane thinking?: Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times. Diane Lane shines in this wonderful Product!: Oscar nominee DIANE LANE shines in this wonderful comedy about changing your life for the better after a devastating blow. Horowitz takes a wrecking ball to the Left: In How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas, Horowitz uses ruthless intellect to demolish the foundations upon which the new Left has tried to rebuild itself following the collapse of communism across the world. Alas, if only the GOP would listen to him. Gene: Dated. More of the same: If you feel passionately about politics and whether having a republican in office or a democrat will make one tiny bit of difference, then go ahead and buy the latest addition to this seemingly endless genre. Beware: Ordered retail, received knock-off: The whole point in ordering a genuine retail packaged Canon battery is to avoid cheap Chinese knockoffs. Hard to trust any other battery: I got an off-brand battery as an extra for my SD800 IS and was disapointed with the life. Perfect: I bought this to go with my SD700IS because I wanted to keep it all oem and just as the one that came with the camera I have to admit I have never seen a battery last longer I have had the camera for almost 4 months now and between the 2 batteries I have only charged both 1 time and believe me I use my camera allot!. Battery: great for when you need an extra battery. New battery in retail package: We wanted a spare camera battery for our Cannon SD870IS. Very Happy!: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there\\'s always a list and it\\'s often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Canon Battery for Power Shot Camera: I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation. The battery that saved the wedding: With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great . Choose Canon brand: I wanted a reliable second battery for my camera to take on an extended overseas vacation. Fine battery: I purchased this as an extra battery for a Canon sd800is. Canon NB-5L Battery Pack: The battery I got has a terrible quality. Must have. Cannon battery: Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don\\'t seem to last as long. Canon MB-5L Battery Pack: I have a Canon Power Shot SX210IS. Perfect backup battery: Although it doesn\\'t get use unless we\\'re out long enough to need a second battery, this product is working just like the original and seems to be a completely legit cannon production (despite a few other reviews). Not the original Canon battery: We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. Excellent little battery: I purchased this battery as a backup for a vacation. Knock off battery does not work at all: I ordered this battery, thinking that it was a \\'real battery\\'. You get what you pay for: You get what you pay for. Not working: I just got the \"New\" battery, but it looks like algoty got opened before. Canon NB-5L Battery for Canon camera: I purchased a Canon camera a couple of years ago and a Canon battery came with it. Brand Name Battery: A no-brainer! The best battery for your Canon camera. Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries. i have get my order: I never got the battery and im still waiting on it, I want to know whats going to happen cause im still waiting. Damaged: Was starting to swell, which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent. Ordered wrong Canon battery: I notified Digi Acc to let them know that I ordered the wrong battery. Amazon mix-up: I ordered a Canon camera battery. Battery does not work with my Canon SD700: There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700. NO, NO, and NO!: I only made it 15 minutes into this Product before I turned it off. THE WORST Product I HAVE EVER! SEEN: I saw this Product in theaters with a friend and my brother. A Confusing Waste of Plastic: The Product has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. OMG, a complete waste of time: Having got the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. Why, oh why, oh why!: Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. Avoid at all cost !!: Some Products are bad and worth watching \\'cos they\\'re bad, this one however is just a total stinker - no redeeming features whatsover. Give me the original: I was surprised and delighted to see this \"remake\". Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage. Don\\'t expect much: The original was original. Far Cry From Original: Don\\'t waste your time or money on this remake. travesty remake on bluray? original not even on anamorphic dvd?: The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release. Great Product, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old: The setting for this Product is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,. What went wrong with this film?!: This film was a major disappointment. NON-STOP ACTION. Horrible stupid Product: Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst Products ever. GOOD drama, GREAT action!!!: Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. R?: What the heck? This Product is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I\\'m not allowed to get or see this Product, which was only mediocre to begin with. Worst Product in a long time: This Product is pointless and stupid. Appalling: This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. The Worst Product Ever!: This is by far the worst Product I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. Rollerbomb: Stupid, vapid, anemic remake of the 1975 film. Top Ten Worst Products I ever Saw: This is somewhere up there as one of the worst Products I ever saw. Pathetic: Rollerball in name only. Spectacularly bad: There is no plot. Proof that God does not exist: How could there be a God in a universe where the insidious Rollerball 2002 remake is available on blu-ray, but the original 1975 classic is not?. A Total Failure: If you\\'ve seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you\\'ll probably want to give this remake a miss. Low-rent MTV fare. Little to say about this embarrassing film. BALLISTIC BOMB: This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Horible: this Product, other than the scenes that depicted the actual game rollerball, was horifyingly (if thats a word) bad. Umm, I don\\'t know what they were trying to do: This Product is just plain sad. The pits: A complete waste of film start to finish. Waste of celluloid: It takes a lot for me to not like a Product, and Rollerball managed to pull it off. The Last Word: Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this Product. Not Bad At All. uggh!: I ordered this border for my new twins nursery! It is truly a cute colorful boarder. Buying another one!: I bought the original 4 years ago, have loved it, and am buying the remanufactured one for our vacation home. Design confuses some into burning kettle: I\\'ve had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it\\'s a standard kettle. Just Like New: Saved alot of money. So far so good: This is our 2nd electric kettle. Jane\\'s Chem-Bio Handdelivery: A useful tool: Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this delivery is quite useful. Needed for class: Not too much to say; it is the delivery I needed for class and I got it at a good price on Amazon. A picture delivery with great photos and interesting historical: This picture delivery has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. Good pictures: This has god pictures and background info on flag. criminally under rated doom metal!: these guys were the cream of the doom metal crop late 80s/early 90s. This is awful: I bought this album because it had some songs off of Epicus Doomicus Metallicus on it but it was a complete dissappointment, it has the really horrible singer that sounds nothing like the original singer, and he completely destroys some of my favorite songs with his awful warbling and squalking. Pretty Good: After taking a long break from rapping, LL Cool J seems to hold his own on this one, with pretty good production and talented guests, this one is sure to go platinum. THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME: Everyone should buy this album. ill joint!!!!: When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it. Disappointed: I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like \"see-through\" clear blue plastic. awsome new blue-eyes shining dragon figure: this is a large blue eyes shining dragon figure from the Yu-Gi-Oh Product! this is the coolest toy. WORTH THE MONEY!!!!: My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh. Blue Eyes Shining Dragon: I do own this toy, and is a huge fan of the film, so this toy for me is very nice. Favorite toy at birthday party: Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is one of my childs favorite toys, it is large and movable with lights and sounds. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!: I simply cannot believe that I paid $30 bucks for this thing. One of my favorite toys!: This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. So much potential, but one overwhelming problem: On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. This machine makes as much noise as a power tool: All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. This is an answer to the TV Guide issue: I have the Philips HDRW720 and had identical TV Guide issues. Engineering gone bad: I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS. A Note about Charles Taze Russell: It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of \"Pastor\" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. Please review the sited URL. Foie Gras: As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras. I used to eat it till I found out how it was made: diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that\\'s what it is. Who eats Fois Gras?: So, Amazon, you\\'re back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American\\'s eat it, or even know what it is? And, it\\'s expensive which helps your bottom line. Jack and the Giant: A product Full of Beans: This wonderful delivery has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!. What a delivery!!: I am using this textdelivery in a class and it is a whopper. Long time quilter: I really liked some of the simple quilts in this delivery. You Don\\'t Need a Math Degree to Understand this: Chaos is such a visually stunning field of study, since you invariably run into those computer generated figures of Julia sets or random fractal landscapes or cloud formations. Very good Product about medical students: Very well taken Product that depicts the sacrifices and passion required for medical profession. VHS tape of Vital signs: Fun Product, but the tape quality listed as \"NEW\" has faded colors- VHS tapes just don\\'t hold up. 89 chevy s10 single cab: i wanted to know if this will fit my 1989 chevy s10 single cab regular bed please let me know as soon as possible so i can place my order. God\\'s Dawn for Every Darkness: This is a wonderful, encouraging, faith inspiring delivery. Cheap. DISAPPOINTED: I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!: I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . Disappointed except for price: I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. Elastic is falling out of the fitted sheets. HOW DISAPPOINTING: That is all I can say - you get what you pay for is clearly underrated - you buy sheets for under 10 dollars - what on earth was I thinking - well, I got paper thin sheets that I hope make it thru the first washing -will use them as emergency sheets for guests that want a place to crash - will provide toilet seat cover-like protection against the mattress and who knows what it will feel like next to the skin!! Warning - Caveat Emptor!. Good for the price: I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. Shrinkage: These sheets look as pictured. Great Price, But. Seamingly poor quality: The pillow case seam tore wide open after initial washing (before I even used the set!). Cozy - great price: Very deep pockets, so fits a bit loosely on a standard twin, but it\\'s soft and cozy. Wrong sheets: I don\\'t know if I\\'m the only one that experienced this problem but I ordered the BLUE FLORAL Paisley set and got some ugly checkered blue design. You get what you pay for, and we didn\\'t pay much :-(: The fit of the fitted sheet is LOUSY - the first night we had it on the mattress, it came off. unusable, avoid it: After 1st wash, even before 1st use. bad: got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money. Not really a bargain--terrible sheets: Dollar store quality. These sheets will self-destruct. poor workmanhip!: These sheets looked pretty until they fell apart the first time I washed them. Flannel Sheets -- Not Recommended: Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4. Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap. My wife loves them!: Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly. One of my all-time favorites: This Product is not for everyone, but I love the absurd humor. Another Warners Archive Collection Bust: As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection. great toy: the toy is pretty awsome. JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. coooooooooooooooooool: this toy looks really cool, but i think they should make it have better graphics and a better screen. Help!In major confusion, WHAT TO BUY???!!!: Please i can\\'t decide. This toy is the WORST!: This toy is the worst! You can\\'t even get past the Password screen to play anything. The batteries died after less than one day!: I bought a couple of these for my sons. Expensive Junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Our 8 year old son ACHED for this toy for his birthday and although we thought it to be expensive junk, we wanted to see him happy. bought 2 and am happy: Here\\'s a tip - don\\'t shake it up and down. The Cool Gizmo: I think the megaman PET is really cool. I hate useless products: You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don\\'t bother. Too complicated: The children were happy to play with it but since the electronics was so poor they were very dissappointed and left it on the table. junk junk junk: it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white. MY SOON TO BE NEW TOY: I Cant wait till christmas then i will get my advace pet i seen what it could do so i cant wait. peice of garbage!!: Okay this game was pretty fun when I first bought it but after that it just wasnt fun anymore. Didn\\'t perform as expected: It doesn\\'t cooperate and isn\\'t very user friendly. People. COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS TOY IS THE BOMB!this toy has the looks, graphics,& the talents!!!even though i have not played it,i think this toy is very,very,very,cool!when i get my PET,i will go bananas!3 questions:1. An Easy Way To Play: Hi i got this game by trading my brother for some stuff he wanted and i started playing it and was disipointed cause you have to shake it so much. So human, so hot: Vickery is certainly the best multi-dimensional male erotic fiction writer today. Very sexy: I\\'m not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. Nice for uniforms: They have a little bit bigger size . material is great: love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product. Great product: Looks and fits great! My son is in high school and these are a part of his uniform. excellent lyrics: If your looking for music that is true to life and chills u out on a sunny sfternoon then buy this cd. mayhem are the gods of black metal!: yeah,. Mayhem Lives!: This may be my favourite Mayhem album of all. Savage and brutal: This is a great, great cd. The cliches were invented right here: There are Hammett fans and Chandler fans. Great Stuff: Second only to Dashiell Hammett, the works of Raymond Chandler are the best in American crime fiction. Pour the scotch and smoke \\'em if you\\'ve got \\'em: What I consider one of the greatest descriptive writers in the Western cannon, Chandler can transport you in to old Los Angeles. Chandler joins the ranks of America\\'s elite  Companys: The addition of this title and its companion volume, \"Later Novels & Other Writings,\" to the venerable Library of America series makes official what mystery fans have always known: Raymond Chandler is one of the gods of American literature. Pathetic: I bought this album because I heard a killer version of \"White Christmas\" on a station on Live365. great!: got this one for my girlfriend, she really likes it a lot so im happy, sometimes sounds a lot like king diamond haha but what can i say it sounds good!. Not appropriate for 9 yr olds: My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it. wrong trikke in box: I purchased this Trikke thinking that it would be a great surprise for my son on his birthday. not as advertised: the item description says this is aluminum, but when i received the item, the box says \\'solid steel\\'. Not what we thought: From pictures, etc. Classic Soundtracks at their Best!: This disc is simply gorgeous! I love classic Product scores, and this is one of my favorite collections. One of my favorites. Not at all what you\\'d expect from fantasy, but. The turtle moves!: My sister got this delivery aloud to me on a road trip from Seattle to California. Good fun, as usual: A really fun delivery, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or . Not Prachett\\'s best by a long shot. MIGHTY ENDING: I have to say this: I enjoyed this delivery from top to bottom. Great: Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this delivery for what it was. To not got this is a sin. The most hilarious in-depth look at religion around!: Like all other Pratchett novels, this one is extremely witty, sarcastic, and equally intelligent. An interesting delivery: This is the thirteenth delivery in Terry Pratchett\\'s series on the Discworld--a flat world, supported on the back of four massive elephants riding on the back of a planet-sized turtle, anything hilarious can happen here, and eventually does. I\\'m a Terry Pratchett\\'s fan: Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it. Now consider the tortoise and the eagle. A Philosophy delivery Encapsulated in Discworld: I\\'ve been goting the Discworld deliverys in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. Hilarious: The great god Om chooses to speak to the human of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. A must-got for whoever enjoys zany stories and good laughs!: Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods. A+: the delivery came really fast and was in great condition, I cant wait to got it i would order from them again for sure. Missing pages in edelivery: I\\'m a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he\\'s created and the incredibly intelligent deliverys. Chelonian Theology: Nobody can discuss serious philosophical issues in hysterically funny ways like Terry Pratchett. moking religeon! , I like it. Finally, a let down: I have got most of this series with great delight. Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation: While the ideas that lay the framework for this delivery are solid, everything else is lacking. simply not that funny: The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this delivery is NOT for you. a disgrace to religion: although this delivery was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. Zzzz. Helpful: I purchased this delivery because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. Grandma loves it: We have some native roots and my grandmother found this delivery fascinating. Shakespeare criticism - a historical survey and sampler: Halliday\\'s excellent introduction makes a historical survey of Shakespeare criticism . The worst mess ever: DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Awful, at best: Wow, this is one of the most useless \"deliverys\" I have ever got. Spend your money better: This delivery is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. Measurements????: Since I can\\'t get Babies R Us to write me back, I thought I\\'d try this. This Product is Funny: I really liked the part when John Candy was at the firing range. AWFUL!: A really horrible Product! Not funny. Incredibly bad: Even for someone who likes bad Products and can sit through most troma films, this Product is too terrible to watch. tbone: thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. the best of anastacia: this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. Anastasia Rocks: The CD is great. FABULOUS! A MUST FOR ANASTACIA FANS!: FABULOUS FABULOUS FABULOUS!! This CD has all the songs I love from miss Anastacia. Fanatical: My nutritionist (who is a celiac) asked me to burn this delivery! The advice is fanatical. The Gluten-Free Bible: There are serious inaccuracies in this delivery that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. Great attitude, if only the info was great. Do not hear, do not obey. Irresponsible!: What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, \"Rx for Health\"? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. Socialite celiac: Although this delivery had good information, it had to be ferreted out. Poor Information for Celiacs: I found areas of this delivery that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. new celiacs need to got with caution: While there is much good information and insightful stories in this delivery, there is also some information that is just inaccurate and/or very disputed within the celiac community. A must got for barn lovers. cuts to the heart: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. magic under a microscope: After goting Schoemperlen\\'s Language of Love I couldn\\'t wait to got her new delivery. Quality Product: Pro - Product is of the highest quality. missing pieces, no response from company: I needed this for a small repair job , but thought it would be useful to have around for years to come. Veclo stap to large: I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe. POID review: The delivery was new and in perfect condition. On second thought: I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. David: In this unique conbination of biography, commentary, & devotional, Arthur Pink offers an intimate view of the many sides of David. Fantastic. Beyond Poor ! Poor, Poor ,Poor, Poor !: When I ordered the delivery it was listed as ( like new ) Hog Wash ! the inside of the delivery was high lighted with yellow lighter and ink pen from beginning to end , there is hardly one page that is not completely marked up. Stunning!: Zelia and her crack band celebrate a yearlong alliance by recording one of their \"rehearsals\" at the Cultural Center in Rio. Zelia Duncan: This is an excellent DVD. Where\\'s the instructions: Was a little tricky without instructions but I figured it out. Bike Basket: Good quality overall. Behind the Eyes: A darker side of Amy. Behind the Eyes Amy Grant: Hello, this CD has some good songs on it too. One of Amy\\'s best pop albums. Refreshing new material by Amy Grant: Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy\\'s two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. Odd that this is my favorite. Great CD!: I think that this is a great album. Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant: All the songs give you that \"uh, yep,,,right,,,ok\". Depressing!: I own all of Amy Grant\\'s other CD\\'s and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. NOT GOOD: Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she\\'s doing? First she gets everyone thinking she\\'s a Christian singer so she doesn\\'t get as much opposition and more positive attention. Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video: If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Godd film for when you\\'re in the mood for hotties!: No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. don\\'t even bother: this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly got, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. Not worth all that money: The content does not simulate the actual USMLE and there are so many nagatively phrased questions and also, most of the questions are never asked as for as my step1 experience goes. Don\\'t waste your money on this: The most unpractical cd i have ever used. Exam Master. Don\\'t waste your time or money: This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. best delivery I\\'ve got in past 5 years: scholarly, well-researched, often humorous look at development of human notions of what is sacred and how it became so. good value: if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. DELL E207WFP 20. Dell E207WFP Monitor: This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. The King sits on his 70\\'s Throne and I LOVE IT!!!: I\\'ve always LOVED this LP and it is one of my All Time Favorites! Lots of Great Soul Music: In The Name, Green Power (MUST HEAR), Dancing In The Street. What\\'s on it: Who would buy it not knowing what is on it, is there any new material, is there a better version of music than previously released, how many, etc. Hard Times: I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite  Company. A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words: This delivery was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Death by verbosity: Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80\\'s did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. Soot-covered Sentimentality: Any Dickens delivery can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. Dark and rich: Dickens\\' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and fdelivary manies to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. not his best, but pretty good: It\\'s the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be got by every high school student alive. The complexity of Dickens: \"Death by verbosity\" describes the critic\\'s failure not Dickens\\'. Boring, Dull, one of the worst deliverys ever got: This delivery was a total waste of my time. Great Nariation but not that good of a delivery. Underwhelmed: This is not Dickens at his best. A good, clean delivery: For my English class, I got Charles Dickens\\' \"Hard Times. Zzzzzzz: I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. Hard Times. Beautiful blouse!: I love this blouse! It\\'s nicely cut and quality material. Worst. Better then the last. more of the same: It\\'s *another* King of Fighters game. Great!: This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon\\'s very low price, this is a must have!. Nice Album from West Coast!: Good Production,With tons of most loved West Coast Gangsta Rapper support,Snoop Dogg, DPG, RBX, Ras Kass, Kokane, Suga Free Ice Cube. Alittle More Of This and Alittle less of That: Bad Azz is dope and getting better everytime i hear him, however in my opinion its his beats and track selection that will halt his progress in terms of album sales and flava. Real Tight: A real tight C. I dont feel it: Im not feelin this album. Down right aweful: I picked this up second hand a couple of weeks ago and I would have been happier to leave it behind. Save your money: This is a 6 x 4. The Safe Place: This product broke my heart. A delighted Teen: Hey,Jake here. Possibilities in the Future: Although the PET\\'s are an interesting concept, perhaps you (the customer) should wait until something more hi-tech such as one with a laser pointer acsess and the Net Nabby actually communicates with you. are you kidding me?: I have 2 boys and several nephews. Megaman PET: This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i\\'m 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with. cool!!!!!!!!: the pet is preety cool its a nice sise and also if u want great game exp. don\\'t buy: I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. useless: [. Cool, man!: My friend had a PET except it was blue. A tight, interesting thriller. Hutton\\'s lost cause: Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film. Outstanding Product!: This is an excellent film, with more twists and turns in the plot than a snake in a pretzel fdelivary many. I expected more. WHAT A WASTE!! DON\\'T BUY!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!: THIS WASTE OF TIME COST ME TWENTY BUCKS FOR A VIDEO THAT WAS NOT EVEN THIRTY MINUTES!! YOU CAN NOT EXPLORE ANYTHING IN THAT SHORT OF TIME!!!! YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON YOUTUBE FOR FREE!!! DON\\'T FALL FOR THE SAME TRICK I DID! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!. Egyptian technique: This is a wonderful video. difficult to program, no access to manual: Sp65 is difficult to program. The sinking of the Carl D. In Nomine Patris et Filii: I love everything on this album. I just dont understand: Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Count Grishnak pales in comparison to Euronymous: Count Grishnak, aka Varg Vikernes should never get credit for any of this music solely for the reason that he murdered the originator of black metal, Euronymous from Mayhem. Colorful Overview of the Islands: What a pleasure to got such a high-quality delivery. An Unfound Gem: This band has a straight forward approach to music that is sturdy, simple, aggressive and a little annoying, in a good way. DON\\'T BOTHER BUYING THIS BRA!: This bra is completley worthless! It offers absolutely no support, is cheaply made and does not run according to size. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!: i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. Nice bra, but sizes run LARGE: I love the style of the bra, however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size. March of the Saint is the one to find. amazing: \"Motor City Moments\" is Regina Carter\\'s 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. Regina Carter. Great CD: Love Regina\\'s work, love Jazz. violin w/a kick: Maybe I shouldn\\'t review this album since I\\'m not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. TRUE WORSHIP: Nomatter what I am going through, Darien and LW\\'s music is always able to bring my back into focus. FRUSTRATING OMMISIONS: IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS VIDEO COMPILATION AS PERFECT DUE TO A NUMBER OF INCREDIBLE OMMISIONS. C\\'est magnifique! il y a du vrai dans ce qui\\'l dit. The Alchemist: Sure this is an interesting delivery. a new king: Steve Tene Bimbo was 25yrs old when his grandfather King Tene died. Inside a Secret Nation: I bought this delivery on ebay, as it\\'s been out-of-print for years. Aids in hands-free phone usage: I use this phone holder every day on my commute, in conjunction with an auto charger and hands-free earset. Riveting: One of the best suspense deliverys I have had the pleasure to got. I did not like it. Uninspired: Gee, I wasn\\'t as impressed as you guys. DRACULA SUCKS: Too many characters that appear for a sentence or two and then just vanish into the London fog of the late 19th century. Come Watson, the games afoot!: Unfortunately, it\\'s two left feet on this occasion. Waaaaay too much in this delivery for a mere 350 pages: This delivery needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Anno Dracula Boring: The delivery was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. Too many names, too little interest. Please make a reprint of this delivery. So glad Titan deliverys Reprinted this!!: It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. Enthralling: I\\'m very glad to have discovered this original, complicated but enthralling delivery by Kim Newman. Alternate Hiproduct meets Classic Horror: Kim Newman\\'s gothic horror novel, \"Anno Dracula\" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker\\'s original masterpiece. Difficult, but all-around enjoyable: Count Dracula has married Queen Victoria, and vampirism is the hip new trend for anyone who wants to be anyone. Anno dracula: product is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Great for drivers awareness: I have got some of the reviews and it appears to me that the ones who don\\'t like this delivery are the children who had to got it. Boring but useful: I must admit, this delivery is pretty lame in its organization and all. Not worth your time!: As of now I am completing drivers Ed. No Editor? Mediocre Content. got this if you carry concealed: This is an in-your-face, tell it like it is, discussion of the good and bad of carrying a concealed weapon.

Armed Response: is essential: If your looking for a great delivery that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. EXCELLENT FOR NOVICE OR EXPERT: For 36 years I have instructed a wide variety of novices, experts and \"so-called\" experts. Armed Response: This is a very good delivery for the person who plans to carry concealed firearms. delivery: Armed Response: A good delivery for Self-Defense folks. Informative: The delivery, although hard to get excited about in the begining, offers insight into confrontations that you experience any given day during your life. Wasn\\'t Impressed: Lots of diagrams and drawings, pointing arrows, etc. LIFE CHANGINGING delivery: THIS delivery WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ( WORK,RELATIONSHIPS AT HOME,FRIENDS),IF YOU UNDERSTAND AND PRACTICE THE SKILLS DESCRIBED IN THE delivery. Crucial Confrontations: A must got for supervisors and managers. Old information: Unfortunately, I did not like this delivery.

Admirable!: Based on her theosophic and new thought principles, these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence. Not for me: I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. Great Record, Bad Remaster: I love this record. Great resource: I loved looking at this delivery. Overall Good delivery: delivery was great and a nice got. An adventure product that fails: This delivery by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. Cute delivery and a fast got: Absolutely charming delivery, great for all grade levels. Good delivery for young teens: Ok, the kids accused me of goting it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. Riding in Cars or Boats with Kids: . Keep looking - this ain\\'t it!: I have to agree with the \"lousy\" review. This item is a total scam: This \"delivery\" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the delivery (claims 264 pages) but it is not. THE CREAM OF THE CROP!!!!!!!!!!: The finest pop songwriters get a piece of their due with this three disc set. Excellent overview: This overview of the trio\\'s songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you algoty own 75% of the songs. An Excellent DVD Concert: As a survivor of the Woodstock generation these artists play the music I love to hear. Excellent DVD: Music for Montserrat is an exceptional DVD. rare concert, awesome audio: I recently watched this at a friend\\'s house. Outstanding content: I have a $20,000 stereo with DTS, SACD 3100 watts. Great Music: This is a great music DVD I love it. Great if you have the RIGHT sound setup: I almost sent this item back because the sound was so uneven going back and forth between loud and soft for no reason. Very Nice!: Phil Collins singing \"Take Me Home\" and Mark Knopfler performing \"Brothers in Arms\" and \"Money for Nothing\" are fantastic; heck, Elton, McCartney, Sting, Eric Clapton, Sting, Jimmy Buffett, Carl Perkins and Arrow are all great. Audio= Very Poor: First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. poor sound mix on many of the tracks: Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix. 10 stars: This is one of the best video concerts ever. McCartney Lovers Only: I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video\\'s (got, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Definitely a collector\\'s item. All-Star Lineup: This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. Disappointed with the sound quality: If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. This is a concert. Josef Strauss and the Family Formula. Good Lens Cap: This is a good lens cap and does meet the purpose. Does what it says. Cannot Recommend It: This product has only one thing going for it. Not enough information. More pricy, but nice to use: True, it is more expensive than non-Canon caps, but after all you are using it a hundred times on a photography day and it works the best (I have a $5 non-Canon one and every time I had to use it it felt cheap and flimsy). Quality product: Fits as expected and is well made. Very good: I bought this lens cap as replacement for my stock on canon 70-200 F/4 none is L lens after I misplaced it. Lens Cap: This lens cap works good. Funny!: I bought three copies of this delivery as funny Christmas presents, and they were a big hit. Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available: With all of the program changes, this delivery is very out of date. Decent start, then rambled: This delivery started out fairly interesting as being an insight to the impact of too much money on children and the relationship with their parents. IMHO not for children: I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. Great for kids of all ages: Delightful product. 1 hour of static rain noise: Ok i admit. be careful with size: Great boot. Disappointing - additional equipment needed: We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom. Great product!: I got this delivery in one day. Lots of adjectives, adverbs, and cliches: The product itself was interesting, but the delivery is not well got. Where is the \"Truth\": As a St. Greased Lightning: This product will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn\\'t let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed.

Good quality: I have bought two of these, about a year apart. Enter Slayer: Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. NOT what I ordered!: I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. 3 years later, it\\'s still chugging along perfectly. I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful. cheap, but not worth the money: This product does not fit tightly. Defective and more?: I had 2 problems with the product. It works with my seven year old Sony Bravia: My husband is using the 3. hmmmmmm!: i bought this so i can watch tv from the other side of the room. AWESOME: i bought for my dad so he doesn\\'t have to sit 3 feet away from the TV while my mom is sleeping. headphone extension. Works as desired: Not completely perfect, but reliable, and frankly, it extends the reach of my headphones. works great: I use this to listen to ear buds at work but the computers are hidden under the desk so this allows me to have access to the jack. Good deal: I am am a musician so I use these with earbuds coming off my computer within my headphones which is powered from my Marshall Amplifier. Does what it should do. Much better quality than expected: I\\'ve noticed very little degrading of the sound, if at all, and this is rare in most extensions. Works Great: Had this for almost two years because my computer jack is too far away to reach. Good for about 1. Stopped working after 2 months: Ok while it lasted. Stopped working after a week. poor fit ruins sound - avoid this product: Product arrived promptly and in good condition. Sounds good: Sound quality is good for such an inexpensive item and long enough to let me move freely around in my office.

Great idea but mine\\'s broken: Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. How Fun!: What fun it is to got a novel by one of my favorite \"corporate\" writers! This is a definite departure from the more business-like stylings of \"Diversity Blues - How to Shake Them\". Impressive and entertaining!: Once I picked it up, I found it very hard to put it down again and ended up goting into the wee-hours of the late evenings! Ms. Beautiful and well made!: Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star.

A New Translation: This is a new translation (2006) of Freud\\'s Interpretation of Dreams. Laughing out loud: As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr. No Table of Contents: Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. Poor Quality Binding: Though the content of the text met expectations (it\\'s a fairly canonical text), the binding on this delivery was terrible. translator confusion: I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the edelivery is J. It was a waste of money and time. disappointment: Was poor quality and some of the original text was not included- was not as described -should be removed from Amazon. A New Older Edition: This 2005 publication is A. the hidden meaning of dreams: The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one\\'s dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Hard got: Such a hard got for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more \\'jargon\\' type language than really necessary. Very bad edition: This edition is really bad. Don\\'t buy NuVision Edition: I just got my 2007 edition copy of \"Interpretation of Dreams\" in the mail so I haven\\'t had a chance to got it. Terrible delivery: My professor was not happy with this rendition of the delivery. triplets: this is a different kind of Product and I love it. strangely wonderful: If you\\'ve seen that strange and wonderful Product, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME SOUNDTRACK: Triplets of Belleville soundtrack and Belleville Rendevous are the same disc. Amazing. In the vein of \"Chocolat\": What a delightful work of art. Erreur: \"Les Triplettes de Belleville\" n\\'a pas reu le Jutra de la meilleure bande sonore, puisqu\\'il n\\'était pas en nomination. The Triplets of Belleville: This a terrible product - boring at best.

Canon Battery Charger for NB-5L Batteries: I would like to say that all of my dealings with Amazon have been wonderful, fast, and not a problem. What a rip off!: I needed a charger because i misplaced mine. inaccurate description: The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new. Said it would Work. Worked great: I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . Does not work: The charger does not charge my battery! And it does not plug in directly into the outlet. Perfect replacement: My original charger lost a battle with salt water, which turned it into a discharger. Cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else: I didn\\'t want to risk a generic charger and got the Canon brand at the lowest price at Amazon.

The product never work: This is the first time I buy a product from this provider and I will never do it again, they sold me a charger without a box and that looks kind of used, when I try to charge my batteries they never did it. Works fine: I had to buy a replacement for a camera battery. Perfect replacement for a lost charger: If you happen to misplace the fdelivary many charger, this is the exact replacement you need for the cameras listed.

Another - case of can\\'t download pictures from camera: This was a Christmas present for my son. nonsense: Can not get the pictures off the camera. I bought this as a Christmas present!: Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose. This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???: I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Janet doesn\\'t beat Michael\\'s Tours, but it\\'s still amazing!: The little sister of the Jackson family has done it her brother\\'s way. JANET JACKSON - VELVET ROPE TOUR: Well another one of my first dvd purchases. Fire the editor, sue the director, annihilate the producer: This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. It Was A Blast: Janet Is Truly Amazing . The One and Only. beautiful representation of janet as a person: this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open delivery of HER product of her life, music, feelings and so forth. Low quality dvd: I know I am just writing this review now but the dvd I purchased was not in good quality. bad deal: This DVD could not be played all the way through. what else can i say she is JANET!: this tour is like a representation of janet as a person what she feels and what she wants in life and what she is looking for and basically happiness i personally enjoy janet in everything she does because she does it so well!. I must be the only one. Are we discussing the same DVD?: Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?. Pure art in sight, sound and motion. TOO HOT TO TOUCH!: THIS CONCERT WAS SO HOT. MISS JANET. it\\'s all about the music: This concert is all about the music and art with a little bit of sex, but after this she became way too sexual in a classless way. Do not waste your money!!: This DVD will not load in your player. Didn\\'t work: Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. Not one of her best. Janet!!!: Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts. good: The concert was her best. Wack She ain\\'t Michael: Janet Jackson works very hard. Superb: Man of La Mancha / 0-394-40619-2Though I find the Don Quixote product to be moving and meaningful, I am the first to admit that the full work of Cervantes can be incredibly daunting - not exactly light evening goting. Didn\\'t even know it was a play!: Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this delivery is because I\\'ve heard of it before and I\\'m trying to got some classics. Not my favorite: I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists. Handheld slots: This is a fun little toy. Such a boring toy: I purchased this slot machine thinking it was larger than it was and also hoping it would at least perform a little better than it did. Immediately broke: Broke the very first time I pulled the handle. Nobody would believe this in a novel. BUDDY HOLLY \"Revealed\": I have been a Buddy Holly fan since I first heard him on the radio in my home town of Sydney, Australia. Very, Very Satisfied !: I really like to Thank\\'s for this Amazing delivery, well done . The Black Art of Xbox mods: Good basic delivery on modding. MODDERS RUIN THE GAME!: You may think you are cool because you took the case off of your X-Box and (wow) followed a 6 step process to install your loser chip. bad: The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Build Skills From Ground Up: Excellent DVD, Explain concepts and methods very clearly. bad product: i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness. great accessory: i love this harness as it makes it so easy to cary the IM7 around. IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great!: Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. 5 star Product , 1 star copy !! SHAME !!: i love this Product, but when i watched this dvd version of it, i thought for a moment that my tv was playing up. A tresured noir given poor picture quality by KINO: The Product is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. Brilliant Product - Dgotful DVD: Kino Video ought to be embarrassed to release such a poor quality print on DVD. I\\'m sooo happy: I am sooo happy now that I finally have this DVD - rarely recognized fantastic film noir - Joan\\'s best and Jack Palance\\'s first Product break. Palaver with Palance: Perfect casting, careful pacing, and precise characterizations are the specialties of this suspenseful film noir. The best laid plans. Frustrated in my search: Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD. Could be Crawford\\'s Best!: Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Great Product But Awful Sound Quality by KINO: This is one of those great film noir classics and Crawford gives one of her great performances. Fun Product, Terrible DVD especially for the price: This Product was fun and over the top. Spine Tingling Thriller!: Joan plays Myra Hudson, a successful playrite who marries Jack Palance then discovers an awful truth. sudden fear: i think sudden fear is a very good example of the so called films noirs and also joan crawfords performace is very convincing as the frightned woman who tries to save her life as well as she can. fun,gripping film noir: even for those of you who don\\'t like the older films this one might grab you. Masochist Dearest: Can anyone who watches this Product ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. WARNING!!! DON\\'T BUY HERE CHEAP!!!! CHINA JUNK!!!: SELLER DOESN\\'T RESPOND BACK EITHER. Bad Product--great company. Embarrassing but No Disrespect meant: I was enjoying the  Company\\'s product but about a quarter of the way through I became embarrassed for her as the  Company is presenting a racist view point on her product. Insightful: Thought this delivery was excellent. Life Changing Memoir: I was in my early twenties when this delivery found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah\\'s voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Very good goting: I had never even heard of this delivery. If you value the essence of producttelling let this product. Offensive: I\\'m a white female who is married to a black man. No Disrespect but. A Wake Up Call: I enjoyed this delivery very much. RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER: And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her delivery. Racist and stereotyped: I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly got) tripe. No Disrespect? - How about \"No Clue\": More nonsense about the typical knee jerk, finger pointing, resentment that takes all focus off personal responsibility. One of the best stories ever: I recomend this delivery to any young african american and women who are having problems at home and with their peers. I love Sister Souljah: This delivery is a must got. Giggra: This is one of the best deliverys I have ever got. Another boring delivery about oppression. Whitey is oppressing you?: They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her deliverys. Horrible Horrible. No Disrespect: You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, \\'tho we algoty have 5 biological. This is a Life Changing delivery!: As I got No Disrespect, I developed a new respect for Sister Souljah - for she is bright, strong, sober, calculating, and in your face, telling it like it is! I\\'ve got works of so-called prolific writers more than twice her age, yet none have touched nerves and brought revelation to me as she has in No Disrespect!I smiled to myself as I got the penetrating questions she asked the people in her life. BADDEST delivery I\\'VE got!!!: FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY SAYING THIS WAS A VERY GOOD delivery. this is not the way to change things. I Support What She Says, But I don\\'t believe It: I got \"No Disrespect after goting \"The Coldest Winter Ever\", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors. Not the real deal: We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. Close to Parallels: If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Continuing the trendy radio feel,still too good!: Yeah it got a lot of radio friendly tunes but still this album is real good. A truly beautiful recording, very personal and deep: A lot of people hate this album. Fates Warning is killer. Fates warning. Disappoitment: It was first FW album I\\'ve listened to. Sci-Fi Natural Law: Here is a recent example of this  Company\\'s online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:\"Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by human are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. A Real Page Turner: Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. Take the good with the bad: Ok, before I bought this DVD, I got all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. Entertaining Education: A good choice for those who are not a ble to make it to birthing class, or those that want additional information. Kim\\'s review: These classes were a lot better than I expected. Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Don\\'t have enough time or money for Childbirth classes? Are the classes full? Watch this video instead! Really thorough and informative. I LOVED THIS VIDEO: The lady is kinda annoying. So helpful!: I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. pretty helpful: My husband and I both enjoyed this helpful dvd to better prepare us for the \"BIG\" day. Hard program to watch: This dvd is very difficult to watch. Super Informative. informative: I think the video was really good, im a nurse so i know most of the information algoty but it will hopefully help my husband. Save your money . Don\\'t waste your money: I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. not worth the money: i felt like i was being talked down to the whole time. Long winded. Way too annoying: I\\'m sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Spare yourself from this: Turns out Sheri is the most annoying person ever. Take the time and go to the casses: This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary. its great: was helpful, it comes down all the nerves that exist before having the baby, enjoyed, did not get bored, its interesting and you feel like your part of the class. Very informative!: My husband and I didn\\'t have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. great alternative to going to a class: My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Just ok: The information is ok. Great Video!: I really didn\\'t want to take Lamaze classes, just not my thing. Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy: Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do\\'s and dont\\'s; breathing exercises, and labor. Daughter loved it!: I purchased this for my daughter, expecting her 1st child. Really Corny but Lots of useful info. Very educational: This DVD has good information, but the woman is annoying. Great for 1st Time Parents: My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. Worth it: My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. Take a class: Don\\'t waste your money. Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. Lackluster, Uninformative DVD: The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. There is no laughing in this video. Because I love condescension: If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it\\'s condescension. Ruined my life. Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!: Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. The most annyoying childbirth video. Don\\'t go into labour without watching this class!: The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn\\'t have to worry about childbirth anymore. A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment. Missing tons of crucial elements: This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. annoying instructor- waste of time: I wish I could give this video 0 stars. blagh: I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. Lots of Good Information: I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. Excellent: Our baby is here, and the DVDs prepared us very well for what was in store. It gets the job done: My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn\\'t have worked. very informative: I bought this DVD because I didn\\'t want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. Better than taking a class!: This video was almost like taking a birthing class. Annoying and condescending: My husband and I couldn\\'t fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. She gets funny, annoying. Excellent: I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. Whiny. Wonderful: This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. Invaluable Resource!: Sherry\\'s a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. Fantastic if you can\\'t make a live childbirth class: We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. could have done without the \"laugh\": very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared \"comedian\" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. Current and easygoing class on childbirth. Better than actual class!: My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule: This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don\\'t have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. Disappointed: I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn\\'t find a live class in English. Good video, not as cheesy as people say: I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). Verry happy with this video - 1st time mom here: I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. Very Educational and Informative: My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class. This DVD really helped me: My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. Who\\'s laughing?: My husband and I are expecting our first baby any day now. Very Helpful. Great Purchase! Worth it!: My husband and I did not want to have to take the time or money to attend an actual birthing class. All I needed to know. Great knowledge for a new mommy or experienced mother: I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. Comprehensive and fun: Sherri\\'s video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Must have!: This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth. good information, but. Rudimentary, though a tad insightful: It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Are you kidding me?: First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. poor choice!: Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library. Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy: Incredibly inefficient information delivery. Great information: I wasn\\'t able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. Great for calming first child fears: I felt completely in the dark about what to expect when my wife was pregnant. BEST Childbirth DVDs ever: These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. helpful: This dvd was very helpful before I had my first baby. laugh and learn about childbirth: Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband: I will give her I did learn something while I wasn\\'t being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps: me and my wife are both professionals. Super Cute Toy: So glad they brought back this classic toy. useless: i was very excited when I saw the ad. very bad quality!!!!!: This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!. WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL: This film lacks all the elements that make Argento\\'s Products great and fun to watch. The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!: I couldn\\'t get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. Why an EP release of this film?: While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14. The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!: I wish I had got the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Slow and pointless: Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. Really, really bad: Argento used to be one of Italy\\'s best film makers, unfortunately with \"Trauma\", this and \"Phantom of the Opera\" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. Late masterpiece by a brilliant director: The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock. the worst picture quality i saw since old rental vhs: Previous review is right. Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Product: Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition): Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense Product director Argento. Horrible blu-ray transfer!: This is one of my favorite Argento Products, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Very Bad transfer. DONT BUY TROMA RELEASE: The Troma release is horrible, do not buy it. You will be freaked: This is one of the best Argento Products ever. Terrible DVD of an impressive film: The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. Watch out!: I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out. video player: I really wanted to play the bingo game, however, the CD\\'s did not play. Liked it: I think Izzy is very talented and I\\'m glad he\\'s using his talent for Kingdom music. An important addition to the mushroom breeder\\'s library. Great delivery for puzzled entrepeneurs!: I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this delivery was used as our text-delivery.

Amature. clan of the cave bear: this delivery opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. This is an amazing delivery. A Scientific Saga: I just finished goting this delivery and I think it is one of the best deliverys I ever got.

I really tried to like it: My Mom and sister both recommended this delivery, but I couldn\\'t make it through more than half. 5+ stars. way too much: I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I got several of the deliverys years ago, but I finally put them down without goting the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them. Its really just a harlequin novel: If there were bodices to rip in the stone age they would be ripping furiously in this delivery and in its successors. The Clan of the Cave Bear: I really loved this delivery and the deliverys that follow this one, but I didn\\'t really like the way the people\\'s feelings are. to much detail: Great imagination! A little to much time spent on details. No plot, No Characters: One of the worst novels I have ever got. Great. Boring: Don\\'t bother wasting your money.

Very good goting. 2nd time around: This is the second time I am goty this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first got them. Clan of the Cave Bear, a true classic: Novels come and go, in our deliveryshelves and in our minds. First in the series. Great product, excellent insight into prehistoric man: While the product and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Cave of the Clan Bear: Cave of the Clan Bear is well got. I Know I\\'m in the Minority Here, But. Kindle\\'s edition is full of typos: The kindle editions of these deliverys are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been got.

So Much Detail that the product Come to Life: I got this delivery a few years back but couldn\\'t resist reviewing it now that I have an Amazon account. Clan of the Cave Bear, good got. A fascinating tale: This delivery is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I fell in love with this delivery from the first page. Prehistoric Research Fiction?: I can\\'t say enough about this delivery. YOU MADE ME FEEL I WAS AYLA!: WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT? THERE HAS TO BE A #5. Tripe, and not very good tripe at that: lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the  Company just bestows upon her. Neanderthal Sexists: This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. Horrid!: I really wanted to like this delivery. Clan of the Cave Bear: This delivery was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. One of the best deliverys I have ever got: I absolutely adored this novel. Sensational. Beautiful!!: I was hooked from the first page!! This is the best delivery ever got! If you have got this delivery, got the others, they keep getting better!! When is the next delivery coming out?. there\\'s nothing better than this: I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new delivery to got. EXCELENT!!!: It\\'s just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. Cave Woman: I had the misfortune to got the other three deliverys of the series before goting clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of goting this delivery.

Totally addictive: Loving this series. got this delivery and get hooked on the entire series!: A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family.

Enchanting and Creative: I wasn\\'t sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. Highly recommended to me, and I agree: On a number of occasions, it had been suggested that I got this delivery, and I must say I\\'m very glad I did. What I expected: Friend told me about the delivery , have not started to got it yet. Excellent compilation on Leadershipattributes for innovation: Excellent compilation on Leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well got articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. brief overview: This is not a delivery, its a pamphlet that gives a very terse overview of the PL/I language. for beginners: This is a very good delivery for the beginners to gain a overall knowledge of PL/1 and start making small programs. Nice for NYG Fans!: Very nice Floor Mats. Very bad logo!! You cant see it. trouble with car not matts: Matt on driver side slides forward and I have not found a way to anchor it. Smooth, great color, and good price: I happened upon this product at Nordstrom\\'s Rack and picked up one. Bless her heart for writing this: This delivery is the worst! It is more like a journal than advice on how to deal with a child with SID. Fun got!: This delivery was a fun, quick got if you like question & answer advice. Pictures!: I bought this for a friend for her birthday and it didn\\'t have a picture posted but from the description I figured it was the old version without the scary lady on the cover but it wasn\\'t. Very dated: If you love Dear Abby, you\\'ll love this delivery. Lots of fun for Dear Abbey lovers: This delivery was great! Lots of old Dear Abbey letters with background information on the thoughts that were behind the answers. Excellent reference guide: I work at a Wild Birds Unlimited store and customers rely on you to give them the best information on bird feeding and care available. Will take a 15. poor quality backpack, don\\'t buy. Mind boggling design flaws: I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!: Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it\\'s influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. Another reason to suscribe to Prime: This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn\\'t suscribed to Amazon Prime. Gripping Film: Very good acting. great product, well directed, fine acting: This Product is quite a gem. Captivating, Engaging, Wonderful: Completely captivating and amazing.

Worthy of Several Academy Nominations: Director Susanne Bier, Best Screenplay writers Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen, Best delivary man Rolf Lassgrd, Best Actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, and a few other supporting and camera work nominations would not surprise me. Very Nearly Perfect: This is one of few films I\\'ve seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography. Traveled to Sweden. very good: Beautiful Product. Moving product and film: I enjoyed this film. Alls well that ends well: This is a perfect product of everything working out in the end. Excellent Enz: Although a little uneven, this release has two timeless ballads (\"Iris\" and \"One Step Ahead\") and some rollicking good time pop songs (Hiproduct Never Repeats, I Don\\'t Wanna Dance, Hard Act To Follow) and the dazzling \"Ships\" which is one of my favorite Enz songs. The real product of globalization: \"Before one can cry Big Mac, Larsson humbles the critic of globalization into silence. Sunny Side Up: I had to got this delivery for a Business course. is that fencer attacking with a bent arm?: and what is with the foot?Usually a preview should (as far as I know) show a good example that will motivate people to watch moreof it and this just isn\\'t it. One of the worst Products I\\'ve ever seen: Poor product, worse acting, appalling film making. A powerful, moving film you can\\'t stop watching. Incorrect Order & Product Color Inconsistent: I ordered:4 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft BeigeThey sent:3 - Revlon Age Defying Makeup - Color 05 - Soft Beige -- (Note: See Color inconsistency note below)1 - Almay Liquid Makeup (which I did not order)Each of the 3 Revlon bottles was labeled as \"05 Soft Beige\" but visually looking at the makeup through the glass bottles, side by side, the actual color was markedly inconsistent. Age defying doesn\\'t quite fit the product: I am a very young looking 61 years old woman. Not what she wanted: Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she got a few pages and quit because it was too sad. sent wrong thing: I chose this rating because I was supposed to be sent both deliverys (combined into one) and the lost boy, but I was only sent a child called it.

Over-rated!!: I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. THIS GAME STINKS!. Great Game. the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: in this game other than the fighting style the animated cut scenes have the best graphics. Best Fire Emblem Yet: I have this game and have beaten but boy it was hard. Fire Emblem on Game Cube: This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the product line is prety good. Worst game I have ever played: Wow. Best Fire Emblem Yet: This game is awesome! I got it and couldn\\'t stop playing! The graphics are awesome! I played the two english fire emblems before it, but this one beats them all. Very fun game: In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting. Epic fun.

My daughter Love it!: My little girl is a HUGE dragon and dinosaur fan. Where are the Pictures?: I am very disappointed in this delivery. Disappointed: I \"bought\" this delivery for Kindle. pointless rubbish: Just as the title says, delivery of nonsense. Limericks: If you are looking for a nonsense limerick, this is the delivery for you - otherwise, keep looking. Weird, Uncomprehendable delivery: This has to be the dumbest delivery I\\'ve got. ???: This thing has about 3 poems in it. The delivery of Nonsense by Edward Lear: He is the best of all writers of nonsense verse. This should not be listed on Amazon: This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the \"The Owl and the Pussycat,\" which from the ad I expected to be included. Excellent, classic, but.

Not really gotable: There are headings for pictures, but no pictures. WWE Road to Being the Best Game on the GameBoy Advance. enterence video: there is no enterence video,no productlines,much lesser wrestlers so its not enjoyable playing mode, so please next time just think about this things so it can be enjoyable while playing on GBA. Wrestlecrap: This is very slow and very limited. GREAT STUFF: If you want some good ol\\' fashion raw speed metal, this is your album. Where to start with MOTORRRRRHEAD?: I you are new fan who doesn\\'t know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further. Good, but it gets better: Motorhead put their blueprint together for this album, and it is very good (especially \"Pay Your Price\" and \"I\\'ll be Your Sister\") but they still needed to hone in on the speed and aggression. Great Early Motörhead: One of Motörhead\\'s best, . Wrong info: I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. The Perfect Portfolio: \"Perfect\" This delivery was incredibly helpful. Better than New: I borrowed a copy of this delivery from a friend who said it only had 2 gotings. Boring, ideas, not worth it!: I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween delivery, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy. So much potential. Thuvia is great: As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series). I adore this series: Romantic, full of action and rich dialogue and imagery, this series will last forever (despite the epic fail of the Disney Product). Less substance than a Cugel novel. A good got. classic: Thuvia, Maid of Mars is classic pulp science fiction. not good: I got the first 3 John Carter deliverys and wanted to see how the product progressed. Better than I remembered it!: got the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. A great find!: I recently discovered this band while surfing the net. Metal all the way. Cheaper (and maybe better than) a Therapist: Though not a fan of his astrological writings for Vanity Fair, this delivery is mind-blowing. astrology: This a the delivery everyone should have- from serious students of the stars, to consultants, to people who know nothing at all about astrology. Couldn\\'t Be Better!: Having never heard of this band before, I picked up this album from a Border\\'s deliveryshop store where I could sample the tunes first. A very good album: The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. A sonic summer\\'s day: I think this is the best Sea & Cake album so far. whoa: Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music. Snoozic: This idea was interesting on their earlier albums. Boring: Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and \"Afternoon Speaker\" is it. OK: Pretty horrible. A \"MUST HAVE\" delivery for IBD info: I have been so impressed by this delivery. completely useless - garbage: at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program. Subscription Flawed?: Bought the 2005 program in the spring. Beware, it crashed my Hard disk!: I downloaded EZ Antivirus trial version from CA and Installed it on my laptop (XP Professional SP1). breaks other programs, can\\'t uninstall: DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU got THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. Very Disappointed: I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection. Unable to uninstall: Once my year-long subscription expired, I have been unable to uninstall CA ETrust. Stoner Rock, I think not!: First of all, don\\'t even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. POOR Quality, stay away!!: One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. Couldn\\'t use it: After adjusting the leg pieces for several days (wearing socks & boots)and then even replacing these with foam rolls I still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product, even at a 45degree incline. Does not work with palm easily: Did not work with my Palm T|C right away. card is actually 66x not 133x: The product title is incorrect. Do not order this part from RitzCamera: I ordered Panasonic 1GB Secure Digital (SD) Card ( RPSDH01GU1A )Which is a 66x speed (10BM/s)I received RP-SDQ01G which is 33X speed (5MB/s). I don\\'t have answers to your questions: I gave this item as a gift. This delivery explains the work of God in a way that make sense. NOT REALLY A LUNCH BOX: This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. Overpriced: I cannot believe the \"discounted\" price of $23, when you can buy the identical item from other suppliers on Amazon for just over $3. Well worth the price: Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else. Doesn\\'t fit!: The bolt holes don\\'t line up. An honest look at goaltending: I found this delivery to be an honest look at the world of hockey goaltending from mites to the pros. I\\'ve never heard a worse one: In all the years of my life, I\\'m sure I\\'ve never heard such an awful musical. Inspiring to tree-huggers!: This delivery is a great delivery for those who care about the earth. You don\\'t buy this one for the plot or the acting. Pervasive Silicone Enhancement: Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this Product. great Product: this Product was for both men and women. Relaxing viewing time: A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Femalien: For this kind of Product your not supposed to get bord and skip through most of it. Femalien: This is one of the worst plots, but no worse than many porn plots. Crappy: Should have 0-star as a choice. Aliens Study the Sensual Arts: I was in the mood for some alien invasion Products the other day and watched a small marathon. Femalien: The R rated DVD of this Product is not worth the price. See It: See this move for Matt Schue. Don\\'t waste your money!: No plot,waste of time and money in this \\'Disney Porn\\' flick with ugly girls and stupid product line,Stay away!!!. Femalien: A soft adult Product. Good ending: While the film got me wet, it could have used improvement. Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!: Big disappointment. Wow, what a letdown: I thought this Product was going to have an incredible plot - All I wanted was to be able to go home and watch a really bad Product. Nil Science Fiction, Strong Sexual Content: Because this video in unrated and carries no warning in the information area I feel shoppers should be aware that this by all rights a soft core porn film with strong sexual content and little science fiction. close encounters of the sexy kind: As a nerd, I\\'d always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end. What a waste: I had the Product before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the \"Flyboys Game\" I thought I would buy it off the market place. pretty awful: I\\'m an aviation buff and I\\'ll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Well Worth Watching: Like the Products \"Titanic\" and \"The Great Escape\", This is a product taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved. completely disappointing: I do enjoy historical war Products when they\\'re done right. Terrible - I walked out of this Product: When I heard Larry Ellison the world\\'s second richest man was involved, I had to go see this Product. A Product or a music video??: What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the Product. Romanticism and Reality: All the elements of a great Product. High Flying Adventure: This Product is very fun and entertaining. Another computer generated teen brain flick: The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can\\'t watch this thing. great Product: i thought it was a very entertaining Product, should have gotten more press when it came out. WWI Product review: This was an excellent Product that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized. Is There A Cliche That Wasn\\'t Used?: This absolutely idiotic excuse for a Product actually got enjoyable after a while, simply because my viewing companions and I began a game of \"Guess Which Cliche Is Going To Be Used Next\". Ho Hum Effort: Fair representation of what could have been a great \" dog fight\" Product. Flyboys (Collector Edition): The Product has 8. What A Bust----Don\\'t Waste Your Money: I\\'m glad I didn\\'t go out and buy this Product. Thank God for fast forward: I asked the clerk at the video store how they determine the number of videos to buy for rentals. Flyboys: What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it\\'s playing the past - this is a trend I\\'m seeing in American productions about hiproduct - what else are they changing that young audiences won\\'t pick up on?. pretty good wwi Product: they don\\'t bother to make many wwi Products anymore, so i was excited to see this one. Fly Boys Lafayette Escadrille,Product for Plane lovers!!: The \"experts\" always!! This Product is enjoyable,the air battle scenes are very well done,product well told,it is for planes lovers not for hiproduct or Product \"experts\",the dogfights are fantastic!!I RECOMMEND for any plane Lover!!For the Hiproduct \"experts\",Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch-Gilbert du Motier, formerly the Marquis de La Fayette (or Lafayette) (September 6, 1757-May 20, 1834) was a former French aristocrat and military officer who participated in both the American and French revolutions. Boring, don\\'t waste your time: This Product is so boring. Almost great: I am not sure which Product all the critics were watching, obviously not the same one I was watching. One Of The Best This Year !: After I watched this film I was goty to watch it again. Flyboys! Don\\'t think so: Aircraft physics [ cgi] are horrible. Hollywood commercial film-making to the bone: Every possible cliche is here. Should been better: Nice actions, but if you looking for a more authentic WWI aerial combat drama try \"Der Rote Baron\" instead. A great action-adventure film. Good Buy: It isn\\'t the best Product in the world, but it is definitely one that should be watched in HD with Surround Sound. Have any of you who said this was good seen Blue Max?: Obviously by all the 5 star reviews who think the dogfight seens are great have never seen the Blue Max. Predictable, cliched, mediocre acting. A $1 rental: The plot of the Product ruins any thing they try to over come with the computer animation, and even that isn\\'t as good as I expected. best Product of the year: Its sad that the Product will only last a week or two in the theatres since it is a good rip roaring adventure that loosely follows the Lafayette Escadrille in WWI. You\\'ve got to be kidding me!: Well, let\\'s not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible Product. Save Your Money: Complete Dreck. this is the funniest Product i\\'ve ever seen: i watched this Product and thought it was hilarious i didnt go five minutes without laughing. CRITICS GOT THIS ONE RIGHT!!!!: This Product was so awful, I felt compelled to warn others NOT to rent it & certainly not to buy it. The Sky is the Limit: The true product of the Lafayette Escadrille comes to life in MGM\\'s action packed war Product \"Flyboys\" The young american men who fought for the French and became the first fighter pilots during the Great War. EXCITING & ENTERTAINING ! FORGET THE CRITICS !: While this film may not win an academy award the aerial fighting sequences make it well worth the money ---plus the acting from relatively unknown delivary man was not bad at all----Those people who tout all the films historical errors tis IS a fictionalized account of Lafayette Escadrille how many of the critics especially some of the women critics have even heard of this name before? --Name one WW1 aviation film that has gotten it all correct you can\\'t --\"The Blue Max one of my favorites had pilots pulling on some sort of handle to fire their machine guns (all wrong) and had lozenge camouflage on the Fokker Triplanes which was also wrong --there is plenty wrong but I still loved the Blue Max as I love this film too---Maybe director Peter Jackson (King KONG) (who is rumoured considering) remaking the BLUE MAX WILL GET ALL THE SMALL DETAILS RIGHT AND ALSO make a kickass film that even the critics will have to love! Go see FLYBOYS You will be entertained!. Painfully fake: For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. A truly bad Product: Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad Product. Overall purchase: I wasn\\'t sure what to think of the Product since I remembered hearing little about it. Visually Stunning: I loved the Product, it has everyting Great direction, Stunning visuals, Good looking cast, Great locations, Superb arieal fight scenes, Awesome Blu Ray picture & sound quality. What a Lemon: I ordered Flyboys because I had seen stills of the replica Neuports and they looked fantastic! As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Be Forwarned!!!: I usually do not review films, but in this case I feel it neccessary. Flyboys: The acting and aircraft sequences are very good. FLYBOYS: I enjoyed this Product as it was entertaining with a war era/love product theme. Well Done Aerial Combat Sequences, Little Else: This is one of those films where more emphasis was placed on the aerial dogfight sequences -- little or no thought went into the plot or acting. If you\\'re a student of the first air war. FLYBOYS SOARS! Blu ray review. Fly Boys: A very good account of WW1 flying aces. Save Your Money: I\\'m sorry I ever purchased this Product. Might make a good coaster: I went to see this in the theater and myself and two friends could not go the distance. Crap. Excellent aviation Product: No it doesnt have A list delivary man in it but some are recognizable. The product is a bit campy, but the flying scenes are excellent!: This is a Product that does a great job of using CGI to create some awesome scenes. Remembering old times: The music is just as I remember it! It brings back so many memories. Tight Dope: Dude, this CD is all sick! It is so totally awesome, you MUST buy it. This is not \"98 Degrees that play their own instruments\"!: What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. Sheesh, pull kids away from the radio!: I don\\'t own this, which is surprising because I love to \"discover\" new acts. This is one of my all time favorite cd\\'s!: I absolutely love this cd. Souldecision\\'s a hit!: Hey,I have been lucky enough to meet Trevor(blond spiky hair and lead singer) Dave-brown hair, Ken(other blond plays keyboards and they are very nice guys! Their cd is also good, especially Let\\'s Do It Right, Faded, Ooh It\\'s Kind of Crazy. The Bomb: this cd is the bomb that has great songs like fadded, stay, and gravity. Great album: For anyone who considers them in the \"boyband\" category, they were around making (playing the instruments, and writing the songs) their music long before the current craze; besides, if it\\'s all about the music, it\\'s a different sound, though still firmly in pop. Needed in every Brio railway layout: This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size. religious guides: I am impressed with the language and content of the Missionary Pal: Reference Guide> I did not expect to see references from several religions, but was glad they were mentioned. Great Item!: We were so excited to get this item. Bias Shows Through: While this delivery is very good on providing scripture quotations, the commentary is dated and extremely biased. THESE COME AS ONE PAIR, & NOT 3 PAIRS AS PICTURED!!: I\\'m sure these are great socks, but I was slightly disappointed when I thought I was getting 3 pairs for the price listed. Great Socks: I wear these socks on a daily basis and I am very happy with them. Gold Toe is the Gold Standard: Love these socks from Gold Toe. fab delivery for cowboy gear: This delivery is fascinating for its Delivary man & hiproduct for me the Aussie, we just dont have these cowboy suits in our hiproduct, & as a sewer who makes cowboy shirts in Oz, it interested me greatly, I got a 2nd hand ex library delivery & it was mint. they have taken a step back: i was also excited about buying this game only to find out that the people at visual concepts had taken a big step back. This game rocks!: Ok, for all those people who aren\\'t good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. Completely amazing!: The signer\\'s voice is wonderful and the beat gets you moving. Dry and Humorless: I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other delivery when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. Booooring!!: This game is way to easy. Saperstein is a no talent: He has the eye and ear of an advertiser. The best of Raymond Chandler: This delivery, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Long drawn out. Energetic, Tantelizing, and Spiritually Moving!: Wendy Rule has done it again, with this release. Sorry Wendy: I would have given this album a 5 had I not heard Zero first, but then nothing beats a live performanceBB. Music for the 21st Century: This is one fantastic CD. I finally found a delivery I can understand: I have got this delivery slowly and thoughtfully, letting Jesus\\' words sink in. Easy to got, packed with wisdom: I have thoroughly enjoyed goting Parables. Excellent got!: I\\'ve given three or four away for others to got. The Parables Review: As a Precepts on Precepts student doing a 23 lesson study on Matthew, I thought this would be a good delivery to help understand Jesus\\' parables better. Beautiful: This Product is just brillant! Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fabulous. The Velvet Goldmine with wigs and panniers: The incoherent plot and screenplay are both laughably bad. To waste time only. Pretentious and Predictable: There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. One of the worst Products EVER !!!!: I don\\'t get it. A Real Sleeper: Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. Pleasently Surprised: I bought this Product on a whim, knowing that two of my favorite delivary man were in it, but also knowing it had not done well in the theatres and that one of my LEAST favorite actresses was in it. A new old fantasy: A very good delivery with a lot of fun. Beautiful Photos, Great Info: I am a beginner backyard bird watcher and I really enjoyed this delivery. TeddyBears: Okay. Techno with a twist: A group that\\'s fairly unknown in the south but worth a listen. Captures a certain amount of Zeitgeist: Disclaimer: this is not my usual genre of music, inasmuch as I prefer rock and adult contemporary. My new favorite record: I saw these guys at Coachella last year and not only do they put on an amazing performance, there studio work is nothin short of superb. Oh my gosh. Very Different From Jaffe\\'s Usual: The first product is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. Now I want to meet them: This is a sensational delivery! I don\\'t want to sleep on the ground. Hostel is better, but not by much. Great in theory. Intense: I love how this Product shows the two extremes of Brazil; the beauty and the beast so to speak of touring a country that has extremely lovely beach and jungle areas, but also bleak areas of poverty where corruption and crime ruin lives. Hot women and freaky moments: I don\\'t get why this Product isn\\'t more popular. Could Really Happen: A lot of people have compared this to Hostel, but this is a much better Product than Hostel. Stay far,far away from this garbage: This Product is so haorrible its not even funny. 2 stars for 2 scenes: 1 girl running off cliff and 1 girl still awake while being operated on (creepy). Not a great Product!: I thought it was pretty bad. It\\'s like watching the show LOST!: Is it just me or did I feel like I was watching a missing episode of the show Lost? Just kiddin but anyways I thought it was a lil like the show Lost a bit but this Product was horrible. Humbug!: This may not be the films fault, but I did not like it. Turistas: This turned out to be a really good Product! I actually saw this Product for sale in Blockbuster for $5 months ago, but after goting the description of it, chalked it up to being another edition of Hostel. Just Awful: Horrible acting, worse plot. Better than Hostel !! Check it out !: Surely, Hostel pushes gore into new level. suckfest: if you gave this Product more than 1 star you are high. Um. horrible: this Product was just plain bad. Trashstas!!!!!!!: For reasons I\\'ll never understand, someone at work gave me this \"Product\" to watch because they said I would like it. Low Budget: Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget Product. A good Product but not a horror film: If you\\'re going to buy \"Turistas\" expecting to see a Hostel\" Eli Roth\" type film . Um. I love this Product, and josh jackson looks real good. The Product That Spawned An NHL Franchise: Leave it to Disney to captilize on the name of one of their kid\\'s flicks. Hockey! We love Hockey!: This Product was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this Product. A Film From My Childhood: I first saw this film when i was younger in the summer at an activity centre, and from that day i bugged my parents until they bought it for me. uhmmm: I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. young hockey fans: My 6 yr old grandson loves Products on my kindle fire--and hockey fans of all ages in our family love the mighty ducks. Good Family Product: This Product had funny parts, and a good lesson for kids: Don\\'t take your life too seriously, have fun once in a while. Good hockey Product: Good product line for a hockey Product. You don\\'t have to know hockey: One of the things that I like best about these Products (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn\\'t follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these Products and even learn something. Family-Friendly Hockey Fun: If you\\'re looking for a good hockey Product that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. What Happened. What happened to this man?: I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister\\'s hit sitcom \"Moesha\" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Please make it stop!!!: I\\'m sorry but Ray J can\\'t sing worth a damn. Career Advice Ray J:Avoid a Recording Studio: aside from the Fact that I was only trying to get the Cut He did with R. Ray-J has grown up. He\\'s not quite there yet. This is horrible: Out of the whole cd Ray J has just good song called \"One Wish\" the cd is a mixture of songs that don\\'t make sense and he shouldn\\'t be singing. If I had one wish. Ray J Stepped His Game Up: I don\\'t care what anybody says this album is tight. WHY?: Ray J is not a thug. If i had one wish. Pure Rated Garbage. The World Ain\\'t goty 4 Ray J: This album is one of Ray J\\'s finest works. I love it Ray J has soul!: I love this cd so much! hes really grown up hes only about a year older then me but hes still sexy and he can sing sing sing i love the majority of his cd i love blue high heels melody one wish and war is over featuring his sister brandy hes stepped his game up and hes not a little boy anymore so if you like rnb and good sounding music go out and cop this cd its a real slow jam banga! im lovin it! hes so so sexy now too hes grown up and i think his cd is underated by most people so if you like soul and rnb and hip hop all rolled into one you will love this cd i guarantee you\\'ll be playing it on the regular i know iam! its one of my favorites! love it love it he has such a great vocal range and a great body too :-) so if you like soulful great fun love music get this cd and stop hatin on the brotha for makin some good tunes that you can really groove to cause im lovin it i give it all 5 stars!. I knew!!!!!!: I knew he would do it. Noise Pollution: Every time I hear that song \"One Wish\" it makes me want to throw up. Not worth it: And I only paid $23 for it. Not as described: Package says one size fits most queen. good stuff: the product is cute and just what i was looking for. Want more: An interesting experiment. Dead On Arrival: Normally, I would never buy anything from Harman Kardon. The Most Understated Guitarist of our Time: Blues Saraceno is nothing short of a demi-god when it comes to musical genius. GREAT,GREAT,GREAT!!!!!: There should be a warning label cautioning drivers not to listen and drive. Magum\\'s finest?: Magnum\\'s \"Vigilante\" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. This could be the best yet. Quiet Nights: Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn\\'t be minimized. Bebel Gilberto does it again!: Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best. Yet another solid collection. Disappointing: Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. A real disappointment: I stumbled upon Bebel at the deliverystore with her first album. Good album: Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. Ultra Force Field Jacket: The real deal. Fabulous customer service: Gomadic brand product does the job and seems well made. The Teenage Tragedy Phenomenon: For some inexplicable reason teenage tragedy was a pop music phenomenon in the late Fifties and early Sixties and this single-disc collection hits all the highlights. An example of silly science fiction: Miss Pickerell is a spinster with a cow, a love of rocks and a very old car. Coffee Table delivery - good for ideas but no plans or detailed design: If you\\'re looking for a finnish fireplace design delivery, look on. Not DVD Quality: I\\'m getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs. Meh. Quality: This is a quality product. Thomas the Train tracks: This is a good product, but highly over-priced. Not Moorcock\\'s Best: Blood is a delivery that seems to have too many interesting ideas. Mediocre: I have been goting Moorcock\\'s work ever since I encountered his creations while playing RPGs in the early Nineties. Great Value Priced CD: Saw a TV Show not long ago with the Everly Brothers in concert and hadn\\'t really ever though much about them, they were before my time. The BEST Everly Brothers album you will ever need,: Long ago in californialand, i heard the last everly brothers \"hit\", on the wings of a nightingale, 1 time and i knew I HAD to have it. Everly Brothers: These brothers were early rock favorites of the teenage crowd - a kinder, gentler time. NBA 2k3 VS NBA 2003!!!!: Unlike the other reviewers, i\\'ll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. 2K3: This is the same as playstation2 verison i love all ov the 2K\\'s this has better graphics then playstation2 but this is a good gane overall. Sega Sports Rules: Best basketball game out there. Don\\'t believe the hype. A complete piece of junk: This piece of equipment is aweful. Piece of grabage - STAY AWAY!: I have about 20 hours invested in this thing. Does not work properly, COMPANY NO HELP: The DVD maker is easy to setup but the one I have doesn\\'t work properly. Problems with drivers and Syncing - Don\\'t Buy: Drivers for XP gave trouble. bad: Not happy with this product lots problems!!!Not work at all for me. ADS works fine. Good piece of hardware, C+ software, terrible tech support: This product is a good idea. Not for XP: I have a 1. Worst ever: I would have rated this minus 5, but that was not an option. Instant Piece of [junk] is more like it: I was unable to get the driver for Win XP Pro to work. USBAV-700 Software Wouldn\\'t Load: Was unable to get the USB drivers for this item to install correctly. Wonderfully inspirational!: If you\\'ve ever wondered *what if* about a past love, this is the delivery for you!! A GREAT got!!!. Bravo!: Though some of the works here are better than others, such as \"Milagro\", and \"The Integral\", Ms. Snapped right into my 03 Accord: This is a pretty good product. This one\\'s a loser: Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. not that much of a heartache . A comidy thriller: Jessie Woods,my great great Aunt, has had such a wonder and histerical life. Grat delivery!: A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920\\'s and beyond. This is the worst hockey game!!: This is the worst hockey game made for this season. certains bugs viennent tout gacher: le jeu est bon mais comporte des bugs sur xbox live , les statistiques ne sont pas compiliees correctement sur xbox live. The Widowing of Mrs. waste of money and time: I bought this cd and have been disappointed from day one. Couldn\\'t get it. Two discs won\\'t play. Ick!: I was expecting the  Company to continue with some Dickensian darkness and magical whimsey. Very imaginative and mysterious: Did you ever wonder what may have happened to Tiny Tim, the Cratchett family, or old Mr. Brilliant: I got this delivery over the summer and it was so good that I kept putting it down as I didn\\'t want it to end! Dicken\\'s \"Tiny Tim\" is now all grown up at 23 in 1860 and is living in a London brothel, where he teaches the mistress how to got and write in exchange for board. avid goter: BORING. Tiny Tim in Adulthood: Mr. one of the worst: This delivery was one of the worst I have ever got. Disappointing: Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. Couldn\\'t put it down: Bayard is not Dickens, but his characters and plot propelled me around Victorian London. not really a memorable product: I got this delivery a couple of months ago and I cannot remember much about the delivery, it being totally forgetable. Pea Pod Babies: The delivery was in great condition and it is a great product, but the seller neglected to include that their was a personal note inside the cover. The Dutchman: I enjoy hiproduct and this historical fiction was terrific. Wrong Poster: The poster I received is okay - it\\'s the one with \"Planet Earth\" got in italics along the bottom, instead of EARTH - but I really would have preferred the one I chose to spend money on, especially since you can buy the one I mistakenly got for . Wrong Poster: They sent a similar but incorrect poster, that is only about half as cool. RICKY MARTIN LIVE! REVIEW: IT WAS EXCELLENT. Glad I finally found it!: I remember watching this on TV and taped it them. Ricky Martin is the best: Ricky Martin is the best don\\'t . doesn\\'t work if you wear glasses: You look thru a pin-hole to get the sighting, but you can\\'t see thru the pinhole if you wear glasses. Huh?: I have never given a Product 1 star before but here it is. Enigmatic and moody and pointless and poo: Save your money and time. Not happy. They should have stayed in the fourth. Cheap backup: There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap. Handy, or better yet heady flashlight. Interfaith Symbol Charm: The order came in a timely manner, It was in perfect condition. a minor delivery on the everest tragedy: lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the delivery is choppy and doesn\\'t grip you like some other deliverys. wrong category !: This is not a delivery about climbing - which I found kinda funny for a delivery about mt. SAVE YOUR MONEY: If you feel you are interested in goting this delivery I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter. BORING SELF-INDULGENT DRIVEL: As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt. Self-absorbed garbage: Of all that has been got about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. This delivery is not worth your money. Just an attempt to cash in on the \\'96 trajedy. Yawn! Wake me up at the end. The most powerful account of Everest I have ever got. Excellent perspective from a member of Scott Fischers\\' team: A refreshing account of the 96 Mountain Madness Everest expedition from a women who must command respect from the mountaineering world. Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness?: I haven\\'t got this delivery but I\\'ve got Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,: The delivery is poorly got with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. A badly got delivery!: The  Company came across as a rather selfish and arrogant person, totally self involved. Stick with Krakauer!: What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. All About Lene: After goting Into Thin Air, I have got everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. A Major disappointment: Like several others who have reviewed this delivery, I found it a total waste of time. Boring and shallow!: There\\'s not much to this shallow account of the \\'96 Everest tragedy. Self-indulgent drivel: I purchased this delivery looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. Cosmological Eye: I recommend this delivery for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. We love it- a must have!!: My daughter watches this daily and loves it just as much every time. helps children feel less afraid: My daughter who is a huge Elmo fan enjoyed this DVD. Too Scary for Younger Tots: While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My son\\'s absolute favorite!: We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son\\'s second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home. Very Educational!: I have two year old twin girls who are absolutely mesmorized by this film, every day they insist on watching it, and have learned how to handle situations involving a fire without even realizing it. Scared Stiff: My son\\'s day care showed the Elmo Firehouse Video and he was very scared! He cried so hard they had to remove him from the room. Not Actually Available: Tried to watch this using our ROKU (we\\'ve watched other amazon content this way), but when you try to watch, it says content not available. Too boring: My one year old loves 5 of the Sesame Street DVDs we ordered for her. Bad job!: I bought this video thinking that it would be a great tool to teach about fires. Poor quality: The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Very good DVD, better than watching Barney reruns over and over. Very Good Western: Randolph Scott and Budd Boetticher combine their talents once again to make an exciting western/civil war Product. A good, traditional western: This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc. Disappointed: This delivery basically gives you the hiproduct of words and how they were established. Vocabulary Extender: Boring, poorly set up, no dynamic or real plan to sit down X number of hours a day and cover Y amount of material so you can become exponentially more glib. Vocab Builder: Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a delivery of this nature on hand, literally. Not up to HD standards: This game is poor - not realistic for anyone that rides a Harley. Simple fun stress relief: This is definitely an arcade-type game. A Master Teacher!: Avery Dulles takes the untrained goter on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner. great cd: Probably ostaras best release to date. awsome: this was great i got the product earlier then i expected and it was in the exact condition that was stated on amazon. PERFECT!!: I absolutely love this series and I am so excited to have it! It\\'s great to be able to watch all your favorite episodes. CSI continues to bring the detective side out of you. no sale: The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. Grainy, CC only with WMP: This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. worng order: okay so there is no 23 episodes. Season Three Lacking: Though it started out strongly, Season 3 of CSI quickly falls to the wayside. CSI CONTINUES TO SHINE: Having absorbed the third season, it\\'s amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically. csi: was received faster than expected with package undamaged and in great shape. ok: it was good. High Quality CSI: DVD boxed set of CSI season 3, very high quality video for a DVD. Fun Show. Gotta Be There: I love this show. we love it: My 5 year old and I play this game. Kind of: Taz wanted is a really cool game, because it has a lot of things that have to be done. Not so hot: I confess I didn\\'t play past the first level, but here\\'s why. Enjoyable: Vanessa-Mae is a talented musician. The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae: While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn\\'t care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. not bad for a cheap knife!: cheap, light weight, quite flexible, doesn\\'t hold a sharp edge very well- but what do you expect from a cheap knife? I bought it because I liked the shape!Use it, abuse it then throw it away or sell at your next \"I\\'ll never do it again\" garage sale. Very good, but. Disappointed: I didn\\'t even get a chance to play the game because it instantly crashed my computer; the CD was dirty outside when i got it, I\\'m very disappointed. I must be on something: I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I\\'ll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened. This is not what I was looking for: Why are they still selling this? Worth a laugh, but the feature is 30 minutes long and I bet your laugh won\\'t last all the way to the end. SIMON SAYS: GORE!!!: Just watched this on FearNet and will definitely buy this on dvd! I love crappy, gorey, over the top films and while it breaks no ground it harkens back to the beloved films of the 1980\\'s that throw away plot and logic for gore gags and fun. Why Cripsin? Why?: This was one of the worst Products I\\'ve seen in recent memory. Crazy In the Woods: You must buy this film, It is one of the best horror films that Ive seen in the last couple of years. stinker: The premise of the Product is nothing new but the acting was horrible. Disappointing: I am still new to the horror Product genre, and maybe I\\'m a noob at this. Not worth it. truly awful.

I agree with the other reviewer, you\\'ll do better by fanning yourself. Weak compared to the competition: Pros: Uses 6 AA batteries which gives it a long life (about 9 hours with NiMH rechargables) in a fairly compact size. CRAPPY FAN, DECENT LIGHT. great fan: I frequently attend scrapdelivery retreats and crops and am very hot natured - so I ordered this fan for those occassions and it is great and the light on the top of it is an added bonus. A Real Disappointment: This fan is a colossal waste of money - it\\'s not worth the shipping cost, much less the purchase price. Save your money!: I ordered two of these fan/lights. It hardly puts out any air: I can\\'t recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn\\'t actually get any thing done. Ideal answer to a power outage: This is the 2nd Wenzel LED Fan Light we have purchased from Amazon. Great Fan/Light: My husband took his LED Fan Light on RAGBRAI (Register\\'s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) and was really impressed with and so were all of his friends. DON\\'T BUY: This fan is junk! The high speed didn\\'t work to start, the lights don\\'t shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn\\'t work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!. Good Gun case: Pretty good gun case. pathetic: Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert\\'s work, I expected something more from this film. Pointless Product!!: I was sold when I saw how many ratings this proclaimed 5 star Product it had received but to my disappointment, it was just a waste of time and money. Product sucks: This Product was crap. Save your money. one of the worst Cannes winners: That Product was soooo boring. The Worst Product Of All Time: This is the number one worst Product I have ever seen. Are you kidding me?: I watched this film a few years ago, and like The Secretary, it was a truly bad film. A real downer: If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. From A Music Teacher!: This film is outstanding, but I can\\'t imagine the general public liking this Product. Not What I Expected Or Even Close: The acting was good for what it was. Classical music and sado-masochism. Misses the Mark: I have to disagree with other reviewers who have heaped praise and many stars on this Product which I found to be art house at it\\'s least pleasing. Beyond Weirdness: This subtitled film portrays the emotional deterioration and sexual perversions of an otherwise gifted and attractive professor of music. Quite funny: Deadly accurate too, especially the mother stuff. repugnant at best: Well-acted for the most part, it was a relief to turn this Product off. Pretentious bore: Ok. I think I\\'ll go back and hide behind Clementi: I adored this Product in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music. Mostly quite good. Difficult Parents quality: This text was in good shape, no bent pages, marks, etc. Doen\\'t fit to DCR-PC55: This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It\\'s not evil, it\\'s just pretty boring: Giving Sarah a lift from Loch Ness to London, the TARDIS picks up a distress signal and the Doctor lands the ship on Zeta Minor, a planet on the very edge of the universe. One Of My Wife\\'s Favorites: My wife really loves this Product, and I was happy to buy it for her for Valentine\\'s Day. Unbelievable: This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. BUYERS BEWARE! BOOTLEG OFFERING: This film has not been issued on DVD. DON\\'T TOUCH MY MOUSTACHE: I love this Product! It is a tender and funny Product. Beware DVD-R copies: This is the second time I have ordered a Product manufactured \"on demand\" in a DVD-R format from Amazon. Finally on dvd: I have been waiting for this Product to hit dvd for years. A Majority of One DVD-R Product: If this was a professional DVD, it would not be made on a DVD-R disk. A dear old friend: Never mind that Alec Guinness plays a Japanese businessman. a majority of one: I\\'ve loved this Product forever. A Majority of one: I have been a big fan of the Product \"A Majority of One\" for many years. A Majority Of One: This Product is a Classic! So Glad to have found it:) They just don\\'t make Products like this any more. A Majority of One: This Product is just wonderful. A Majority of One: This is one of my favorite Products. Please someone stop me thinking that Green Thoughts is GREAT: I found this cd through some random thrift shop pillaging and have been praising the heavens ever since. Great band!: Video killed the Radio Star. Variedad: Bueno tener este album debido a su sonido peculiar, algunas de sus canciones hasta fueron programadas aca en la radio en Guanatos. Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!: This CD set is false advertising. Delightful Short Animates Stories for Young Children: This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas. monsters1. It didnt work: I kept getting an error message when trying to install it. Not a very positive delivery: I bought this delivery to got to my son\\'s first grade class for Valentine\\'s Day. 0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!: This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can\\'t say enough about how sorry this Product is. the bottom below the false bottom of the barrel: This Product just barely goes through the motions of all the other Products it\\'s ripping off. One star and that is being gracious!: Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic \"special effects\". More like \"Tower of Feces\"!!!: This was a pretty damn boring Product. not proof got: This delivery may be fine for someone that algoty understand web production but it is very frustrating for someone just starting out. Had to return it: Unfortunately I had to return the Blue Ant because I couldn\\'t charge it without the cycle turning itself off. Doesn\\'t warm bottles: Ever been in a car on a long distance trip with a cold bottle and a hungry baby? Let me tell you how obnoxious it is to have a bottle warmer that, even after 20 minutes, still has not heated that cold bottle. doesn\\'t work for me: I have regular avent bottles, and I seriously need to warm the bottle up for 30 mins just to take thechill off, the. to long to warm: where to begin, this product takes atleast 10 to 15 minutes to warm up a 4ounce bottle, and anyone with a small infant that is hungry knows this is entirely to long, would not recomment this to new parents at all, I now take a reusable bottle and fill with hot water and use that to warm up bottles. It doesn\\'t even get warm to the touch, much less heat a bottle!: We got this for on the go use and it doesn\\'t even warm up to the touch. it is a joke: this bottle warmer is just a joke. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!: I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. Don\\'t overheat your bottle!: The Munchkin bottle warmer is quite easy to use, and does a terrific job warming bottles. I\\'d pass on this one: This bottle warmer seemed like a great idea--it was great to take the chill of a cold bottle. Cannot be used with Playtex Nurser Bottles: I was very disappointed to get this product and find out that it cannot be used with Playtex Nurser bottles. So HOT it caught on FIRE!!!: Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. Didn\\'t warm at all!!: It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn\\'t warm the bottles at all. Don\\'t waste your money: I purchased this in hopes of (like everyone else) having something that would warm a cold bottle in the car fairly quickly. Takes FOREVER: I noticed some reviews saying this bottle warmer got so hot, it started fires. Chilling & Fast Paced: As of now, this is Leonard Goldberg\\'s last delivery in the Joanna Blalock series and, in my opinion, the best yet. My daughter think this is fun,but not that fun: I bought this for my daugher on her birthday she liked the doll, but she did not love it. adidas: was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50. I guess Cali Iz Active: Daz, Kurupt, and Snoop put out a pretty impressive album which starts out great with the self named track Cali Iz Active. Tha Dogg Pound: This album absolutely sucked. Cali iz inactive: Dont get it twisted. title track was cool&then the rest is a Coaster: Tha Dogg Pound was banging 10 years back,but they lost there Groove long ago. Impressive: I was greatly impressed by this delivery. Save your money: I wouldn\\'t bother with this one. Don\\'t bother buying this one: After traveling using a Berlitz phrasedelivery in Italy, I went to Thailand, and bought the only one available -- Lonely Planet. A lot of useful info in a very small delivery: This is a very compact delivery, easily carried in a shirt pocket. america the Beautiful: this delivery works great for teaching the song. Beautiful delivery!!: The illustrations are just beautiful, I will use the delivery to teach my students the beautiful song of the same title. It has wondeful illustrations. It really had potential, but. A harlequin romance set a sex club: I found this delivery to be rather silly. Good delivery!: I\\'m a huge Anne Rice fan, and I bought this to add to my collection. ~ Erotic Fantasy ~: This is a lovely erotic fantasy. Only if you liked the Product: If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you\\'ll find this delivery an interesting got. hot: Ann Rice writes erotica like no one else!! A must have for your library. Needs more to it. Trashy: I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. Not what I expected: This wasn\\'t at all what I expected. A glimpse into the real world of s/m play. An erotic love product for Nineties. Dissapointing: Dissapointing compared to Anne Rices other works such as Interview With The Vampire. Be forewarned. Not her best work. One erotic passage in the entire delivery. I was extremely disappointed!: The delivery just did not hold my interest very well. One Of The Worst Anne Rice deliverys!: I have to say that this is one of the worst novels that she has ever got. some deliverys suffer from abridgement: The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual delivery is a huge disappointment. Not what I expected. What was this. Disallusion: I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men \"whipping\" someone for reasons I can\\'t fathom. Not Sleeping Beauty: I bought this delivery because I thought it would be similar to her \"Sleeping Beauty\" series. Let down. Pathetically bad!: This is some of the worst trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. Magical Adventure: Anita Jeram\\'s delivery, I Love My Little productdelivery, is a favorite of my 6-year-old son. Vexx is very good: I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(. Great Game: This game would get 5 *s if it wasn\\'t so. cheap cheap cheap. The title gives it away: A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Wax coating and taste: I try new energy/protein bars for variety and to see if I\\'m missing out on something. Lose Weight, Feel Better, Eat Right, Get Omega 3\\'s and More: I am absolutely addicted to this flavor as well as all of the other bar flavors. Not a fan of these: I\\'ve tried all 3 Zoe Bars. Didn\\'t like them: The first thing I noticed about these is they are very dense, with a very waxy but dry and gritty texture. spirited: My brother lives in Bangkok and I\\'ve been there many times so I was keen to see what a novel set there would be like and I wasn\\'t disappointed - Mr Moore evokes the seediness and poverty without it appearing soul-destroyingly hopeless because he manages to balance it with interesting characters (both the good, the bad and the humanly flawed), a good mystery and moments of beauty and humour. Gets better over time: I almost gave up goting this delivery after a couple of chapters for the same reasons as the 1-star reviewers. One of the worst deliverys I\\'ve ever got. So bad: This is simply terrible. sorry. What the heck is up with this cover?: \\'Herland\\' is hardly a cracking got, but it\\'s interesting as a feminist-historical text. The worst delivery ever got. Quite possibly, the worst delivery I\\'ve ever got: This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. Wonderful feminist novel: This is a great, imaginative delivery, one of my favorites. Not Deserving of its Clout: I know that \"Herland\" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. Wrong delivery: wrong delivery sent. Good delivery but took forever to get to me: I ordered this delivery in March and did not receive it until June, way too long to wait for a delivery. A sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child: \"A Campfire for Cowboy Billy\" is not only a charming tale, it\\'s a resonant one. This delivery is hard to understand: This delivery is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn\\'t make sense. Burn This delivery! - OK No, Just Kidding: If you wish to got an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, got the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. takes a wrong turn: fahrenheit 451 starts off well, but definately doesnt end that way. Skip 451: Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. Hated it: could not stand this delivery. Very SLLLOOoowwww. If you want action, dont got this: If you want a delivery that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then got a comic delivery. blah: I had to got this for school. This delivery is not \"hot. fahrenheit 451: the delivery has a good theme but it just dragged on. In My Opinion. Bad got - Wasted money: I think this delivery isn\\'t worth the money you pay for it. The usual dreck: I had to got this when I was in high school. This delivery was very boring: I had to got this delivery for school, and it is one of the most boring deliverys I\\'ve ever got. got this delivery . This delivery sucked: This delivery sucked. Please burn THIS delivery!!!: Too bad this delivery wasn\\'t included among Montag\\'s targets during his career as a \"fireman. DONT got THIS delivery: Ray Bradbury tries to write a bestseller in this boring novel. This delivery is boring!: This delivery doesn\\'t deserve a maximum of 1,000 words! It is pointless and inconsistent. this delivery was awful: This delivery makes absolutely no sense at all. A Bad delivery: The delivery Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to got. This delivery was really odd. Fahrenheit 451 was a good delivery but hard to follow: I give Fahrenheit 451 41/2 stars because the ook keeps the goter on edge. Reality check in a world that needs it: It\\'s amazing how a delivery that was got nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any goter, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Among the Best Ever: Brilliant. Fahrenheit: This is perhaps the most thought provoking delivery I have ever got. The Hearth and the Salamander: A future in which deliverys are burnt, teenagers are violent, and free thinking has been destroyed. The Hearth and the Salamander: Bradbury creates a world of extreme censorship that is our future, where firemen burn deliverys and houses in which they are hidden. Scarier than LIFE: Learning to appreciate everything around us is difficult, in today\\'s society. Censorship has never felt so real. Critical View: Bradbury\\'s view on the future is startling. Is this where we\\'re headed?: Another delivery I got as a young man and dismissed. A Scary Preview of the future of American Society: I first got this delivery after my mother, a senior english teacher, was getting goty to have her students got Farenheit 451. Great delivery: The  Company did a great job. Fascinating!: I started writing sci fi because of this delivery. Good delivery: This is definitely a well got delivery. Amazing: I personally thought that the originality of the plot was what made the delivery interesting for me. I generally liked this delivery. Engaging fast got: Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy \\'to got\\' list for quite a while. A Classic. An Eye-opener: This delivery is so relevant to today that it is scary. Fiction?: I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. Insightful: It is simply amazing how, for a delivery got so many years earlier, is actually quite accurate discribing how things are turning this day in age. good. Not 1984: I\\'ve heard some people say that this delivery rips off 1984, that is NOT true. edeliverys: In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that edeliverys cost more than deliverys printed with ink and paper. Useless that text to speech is not enabled!: Hi!I guess I didn\\'t look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled. Target Practice: Heyyyy I had to got this delivery for school and it was the worst thing I ever got. A very disappointing delivery: I thought this was one of the worst deliverys I\\'ve ever got. The Worst delivery Ever!: Fahrenheit 451 is the worst delivery I have ever got in my whole life. Horrible delivery: This was the worst delivery I\\'ve ever got. wake-up call: Like all great deliverys that cause a stir, either because of their \"ideas\" or the fact that they\\'re so shocking (think Rand\\'s \"Atlas Shrugged,\" McCrae\\'s \"Bark of the Dogwood,\" or \"A Clockwork Orange\") \"Fahrenheit 451\" took its place long ago among the classics. Orwell\\'s shadow: \\'Fahrenheit 451\\' is a powerful product that imagines a future world where literature is burned and goters are imprisoned. I know it\\'s a classic, but I was not impressed. ATTENTION TEACHERS!: I had to got this delivery in my sophomore Honors English class. CD Fahrenheit 451: I marked one star only because I cannot give it anything lower. Timeless Classic!: Through each page, this delivery carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. Optimistic as human can be, but well thought. RB did a great job describing why censorship is wrong: Bradbury\\'s way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. Simple but Perfect: \"Fahrenheit 451\" is one of those rare deliverys that goes straight to the heart of its issue, what we are doing to ourselves in this TV/Multimedia crazed society. I\\'ve always had trouble goting: I\\'ve always had trouble goting but when I got this delivery for my English 2 class I loved it. A decent delivery, I see somwhat related to 1984: It\\'s a delivery that basically tells of censorship. The father of science fiction and fantasy: Great delivery got it when i was a teen, along with all his other deliverys. Great delivery: All theses years later this delivery still holds up. Fantastic delivery!: I had to got this delivery while I was in high school and I\\'m glad I did! This turned out to be my favorite delivery. Ray is a philosopher. This delivery changed the way I look at all deliverys. My personal worst nightmare: This is the product of how, in a future time when deliverys are outlawed, a man goes from burning deliverys to preserving them. Burning deliverys!: This is said to be the temperature at which deliverys ignite. How Fitting. Intricate, Prophetic, Beautiful: I really loved this delivery. FAHRENHEIT 451: A delivery That Will Burn Your Mind: Fahrenheit 451. Not worth goting: This delivery has been raved about as a classic SF product for many years now, so I decided it had to be worth goting. Thoroughly Disapointed: This delivery is a is got about a futuristic civilization in which deliverys are burned and anyone who is caught goting gets arrested (or worse). An ok delivery: It was very confusing at some parts. Fahrenheit 451. THIS deliveryS STINKS: I didn\\'t like this delivery it was way to confusing, i don\\'t think teachers should make kids got this delivery it is definantly not a kids kinda delivery. BURN THIS delivery!!!: I was FORCED to got this delivery in school! It was pure TRASH! I thought I liked goting. It Deserves Negative Stars!: Last year we had to got this as a class. fahrenheit 451: I order the delivery a week before it shipped and then took so long to get here I had to download the delivery to my daughters Kindle the night before she needed it for school. smart idea but. product good, goting is abysmal! Don\\'t do it!!: I have Always preferred to hear an  Company got their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Disappointed: Looks like I\\'m in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn\\'t get through this delivery. Too obvious for even young goters: I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. Great buy: Great buy. Horrible!: I have never yet received my order, and it has been a month since I placed the order and paid for it. Horrible execution of an addressable topic. Never Received: I never received the product in the mail. Horrible and boring: it is impossible to keep goting this. How else would you like to WASTE MY TIME?: To put it simply: this delivery sucked. Not worth it: I had to got this delivery for school. Overrated!: I found this delivery to be very dry and boring. Was not the best delivery i have ever got. A Time Waste: Simply ungotable. The delivery is not the best!: It is not the best delivery I have got. HATED IT!: I really did not like this delivery! Now, don\\'t get me wrong the idea was good, but the writing was horrible. Confusing: who ever wrote this dumb confusing delivery is in a mental state of mind! Fahrenheit 451 is a overworded description of a fireman who lives on rebellion! It is a bad influence on the young people of the world. Horrible: This delivery was way too weird for me and there was never a hook of curiosity. Brought it all back: My older sister had to got this delivery for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old. Still Relevent: Is the delivery outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. A Great got. A testament to all of the Guy Montags out there. perspective changer: I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer goting delivery but in being touched deeply by this delivery and the realization that the delivery wasn\\'t on my summer goting list I realized it was much more than just a quick got. one of the best: This is one of my favorite deliverys. glimmery and grey: this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury\\'s style is always so greyfor this delivery however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material. This delivery burns your brain!: This excellent delivery captures a society unlike any other. This delivery is a must for society: This delivery was not about neccesarily; the future. Eye-opening & Spellbinding!!: This novel is truly a work of art. Interesting novel!: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent novel that I highly suggest to those who like well-got, thoughtful deliverys. Great delivery!: I picked up this delivery because I was just in need of something to got. Farhenheit 451 The delivery about no deliverys: Ray Bradbury\\'s account of a deliveryless world is realistic in every way. School Assignment: I would recommened this delivery for anyone ages 13 and up. Good Value: This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his goting list. Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451, got by Ray Bradbury, is a delivery that attacks what our society is becoming. Better than I remembered: I got this delivery when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. Oh my goodness. Bradbury at his best: This was Bradbury\\'s best delivery. Extremely Thought Provoking: Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent delivery for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. Alarmingly realistic: Bradbury is a master of the genre. Ultra-overrated: I picked up this delivery with such high expectations-Ray Bradbury is relavtively famous, the delivery is fantastically reknowned, and it is about censorship, an issue that I really care about. Simplistic Viewpoints: While I can appreciate Bradbury\\'s views on television\\'s effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with deliverys. Great: This delivery is in the vein of 1984 and other great deliverys that show amazing foresight. Fahrenheit 451 Review: I originally purchased the Metric edition, Celsius 232. A Review: My name is Laura, and I am doing this review for my english pre ap summer assinment from JMS. F. Strong message and beautiful to got: I was surprised by how much I liked this delivery. Disturbing. Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: If you have not got this delivery yet, you are missing out. Fahrenheit 451 is a masterpiece: Ray Bradbury did well done job. Fahrenheit 451: I chose this delivery because I have got Ray\\'s deliverys before and enoyed them. got this delivery: Amazingly got!! Ray Bradbury is a visionary. Great delivery for today: It seemed at first that the delivery was too far-fetched, that It could never happen. Sci-fi fantasy at its best!: I got this delivery in 8th grade as part of a requirement. A confusing but exciting,well-got,and intellectual novel: A delivery you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think. A very hot got!: Ray Bradbury\\'s product of how he wrote this genius delivery in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. Classic audio delivery: The Audio delivery \"Fahrenheit 451\" was purchased by me as a gift for a friend who has limited eyesight. A point driven home by a brilliant writer: While some  Companys may have ruined this delivery by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the goter towards his point of view. Quick \\'nd Good: A quick got with a big font, and only 170 pages, yet it was so good. All deliverys begin with a premise. Understanding: I believe this delivery to be completely and inutterably crazy. Awful and boring: It was one of the most boring deliverys i have ever got in my life. A good idea gone horribly wrong!: At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the goting of it. How ironic - text to speech (tts) not enabled: How ironic that a delivery about limiting access to deliverys is NOT text-to-speech enabled. This is not a good or bad delivery, but its O. Disappointing. This delivery stunk!: Well, basically what happens without all the boring details is there is this guy named Montag and he is a fire fighter. Turn the stove up to 451 degrees and throw this delivery in!: Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any delivery I got. Great delivery, bad performance: As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his deliverys, he should have the good sense to have an delivary man got Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the delivery, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it\\'s power and grace. Fine novel, but it\\'s too short: Fahrenheit 451, is a fine novel. huge disappointment: at 180 pages i realized that i was one-quarter through the product and not even slightly interested in continuing. What Did I Just got: I don\\'t think I\\'m too dense. Fahrenheit 451: We thought this delivery was a good one, but it started out to be slow and confusing. Too bad Amazon can\\'t help out students: I am admitting this review does not relate to the actual delivery but to Amazon so with apologies to Ray Bradbury. Fahrenheit 451 Audiodelivery: Some  Companys should NOT got their deliverys for the audio format. Burn it!: This delivery, whilst very good to begin with, fails in the end beacause Bradbury attemptes to beat his message in too late in the piece. My thouts of the delivery \"Fahrenheit 451\": I thought there was no point to this delivery what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to got it. NOT PLEASED: I was very disappointed when I received this delivery. More than just sensorship. This is why censorship stinks!: This delivery points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring deliverys can be. The delivery shows a bleak vision of the future of the world: The delivery although very confusing , as the  Company uses too much detail , was intruiging . My Review: This delivery was very interesting, but I wouldn\\'t consider it a Sci-Fi. ahhh it is alright: this delivery was really boring and i had to got it for a delivery report so instead of me goting the whole delivery i just rented the Product from blockbuster and watched the Product it was much easier. OK: The delivery was not that bad-but i wouldn\\'t strongly recommend it. Fell short of expectations&#65533;: I heard so much about this delivery before I finally picked it up. An OK delivery: Sure, this delivery gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the product\\'s legitimacy and worth. A major dissapointment: I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics. Fahrenheit 451, a review of: Fahrenheit 451 is an unusual delivery about an alternate future. There Are Better Dystopias Out There: This delivery was hard to got from the start. A bit on the iffy side . Overrated: I\\'ve just finished goting this delivery and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the deliverys feels unfinished and rushed. Fahrenheit 451 - Not worth it: This delivery is boring. Poignant and relevant still. A brightly burning insight just as important today: This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through deliverys. I HATE THE IDEA OF NO deliveryS!: \"Fahrenheit 451\" is about a future where there is no freedom of speech. FAHRENHEIT 451: Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-got delivery by Ray Bradbury. Great!: I had to buy this delivery for school. The BEST delivery i have ever got!!: I love this delivery. Relevance to our times: \"Fahrenheit 451\" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. Fahrenheit 451: Fahrenheit 451At the tender age of 9, as my 30 year old father lay in a hospital dying of cancer, my grieving young mother packed me off to a theater nearby. Feel the Heat of Words: I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi deliverys got. Couldn\\'t Put It Down!: I have never got a delivery anything like this before. emotional impact: This novel intricately portrayed what Guy was experiencing, if you got this delivery in one sitting and allow yourself to absorb what is happening, you can feel the choas and indecision that ravages Montag\\'s pyche. One of Bradbury\\'s best: I rarely got SF, I\\'m more of a fan of general fiction deliverys like Prince of Tides or The Triumph and the Glory. Skip the reviews; let\\'s play the game!: Based on the reviews below, it appears that people either love or hate this delivery, so let\\'s just play \"What delivery would you be?\" I would be \"The Great Gatsby. Why do teachers force goting down our throats?: The major complaint against this delivery, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to got works they don\\'t understand. Earth-Shattering: When I first started goting this delivery, I realized it was just another quirky scifi delivery, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end. Well Worth The Time: If there is one delivery that you got in high school that you should got again later in life, this is it. captivating: As Montag\\'s fire captain tells him, \"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed. Dystopian classic: Upon goting this delivery, it occurred to me just how much it gets quoted. Uckkk: I absolutly hated this delivery, It not only bored me but it aggervated me to the fullest. I DON\\'T UNDERSTAND. Painful listening: Ray Bradbury was a fantastic WRITER. Poor audiodelivery: This may be a classic product, but Ray Bradbury is not a classic goter. Not up to par with Bradbury\\'s other work: This is Ray Bradbury\\'s worst delivery. The Worst delivery I have ever got!!!!: This delivery was horribly got!! It confused more than it enlightened!!!

Fahrenheit 451 review: The delivery, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction delivery.

Sci Fi Nightmare!: Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. Great delivery. Superb!: This is an amazing delivery. Hurrah for Bradbury!: Art imitating life? One need only contemplate the depths of political correctness to see the coming new order. Great got!: Somehow I\\'ve never managed to got this delivery, even in school. Excellent: Reached in time for my daughter\\'s school . What an Interesting delivery!: I got this delivery for a delivery club and I really enjoyed it. Great BUT hard to follow. How could you give it less than five stars?: When in 8th grade I had to got this for school, the first thought that came to mind was \"Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest. Good got: I have got this delivery more than once, when I first got it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. blame xmas for lateness: Orded two deliverys in December, and got this one just the other day (it\\'s now the end of January). A Classic. Fahrenheit 451: Review: In this delivery, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the delivery to our eyes.

Good delivery: What can I say that has not algoty been said. got it only for school: I had to got this delivery for school, and I really didn\\'t like it. it was one of the worst novels i have ever got: it was very boring and i did not lik it at all. it was okay: I had to got this delivery for school, and at first I hated it. The delivery is very boring and in some parts,doesn\\'t make sense: This delivery just plain doesn\\'t make sense and it doesn\\'t apply to younger people. Profoundly unfulfilling. Classic, for a reason: I picked this up to re-got, hadn\\'t since high school. Absorbing: The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. Terrible, Terrible delivery!: Bradbury is a good writer (I\\'ll give him that), but I HATE his writing style. Great got: I loved this delivery in high school and now that I\\'m goting it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.

Boring, boring, boring: I struggled through this delivery. more a name then a real delivery: this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the delivery i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after goting it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the product is bery weak, and the plot is dull. A bit on the dull side: Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this delivery but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an \"F\" grade. this was horrible: This delivery is one of the worst I have got!! Classic or not it still was bad!!! I had to got this for school and I hated it! It was soo simple.

Hip Hop Uncensored, Vol. A big joke!: This toy is ridiculous! It doesn\\'t do anything. AMAZING!: My brother bought this chair and I was a little skeptical. Good lessons for anyone: Adolf Von Schell is a combat leader, but his lessons apply to any leadership position. Remember: there\\'s no DRANO for the brain-o (beware!): If you want a sick, disgusting, perverse Product, look no further. What the heck?: This Product is weird to say the least. Mindless!: The plot is God and the Devil bet on who will win, a doctor who rapes his victims before hacking them up with a chainsaw, or a victim who is on the run who can win. Could this really happen?: A great got w/a uncomfortably plausible product line. Highly Recommended: This CD is a very impressive debut release, I strongly recommend it. ludwig: Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Dark and dreary: A dead girl is found in a field and that leads us to several stories that kind of involve her. Must see: I really liked this Product. AWFUL!: This was the worst Product I have ever seen. Vile, all too Vile, all too stooopid: That\\'s N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this Product. Disturbingly lovely. Very Simple: Spoiler Alert!They found a dead girl in the beginning of the Product. Poor Quality: Two (2) of the the selections on this disc have static & skip, in fact, the 2nd one just stops after a while. where has ramsey lewies been all my musical life?: It\\'s rare that I can find a piece of music that can relax me after a long week and get me grooving at the same time. Amazing CD: If you are into this type of jazz (ala, Gene Harris, Oscar Peterson ) , you gotta love this CD. Finest Hour Indeed!: This is a splendid collection from a great Jazz piano master who is able to cross over into more popular forms without losing the depth and integrity of his inimitable style. Chemists view of Materials: this delivery is excellently got for the chemists who are getting into materials science. Acts- Build Community: Great discussion in our community group. excellent delivery: good product and good bible study material. Good value: This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it\\'s charging (unless you are hands free). low quality: the charger did work that is the only positive after one day the top broke off charger and the wires are exposed. Car charger for Motorola Razor: OEM car charger so it fits well, seems to work well too. advertised as OEM??: I bought 2 of these and a RAZR battery from EFORCE CITY throught AMAZON assuming that Amazon would enforce some truth in advertising. Definitely a FAKE: This is NOT a real Motorola product, the M logo which is supposed to be illuminated from behind is not, there is a little blue LED below the logo - not even close to the real thing. Works great: The charger works great and has a nice design. Razr OEM Car Charger: This product works great and looks good too. Razer charger: works amazing in my car without any problems. Counterfit item - but works OK: According to the Motorola guide, the charger I received is a counterfit: It has a illuminated blue dot rather than a fully illuminated \"M\". Cheap price good product: My parents use this and it\\'s made by motorola. Excellent Product: This Motorola product is perfect. Won\\'t Recharge Anything: I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It\\'s Inexpensive and it Works: I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores. Exactly what the family needed. No worries: I have algoty used this item several times. Great Value for the Money: I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. disappointed: This product did not last two months. DOA: This item arrived as advertised.

Gets the Job Done: Not much to say--it\\'s an inexpensive, effective charger for your car. the dharma rings twice: The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this delivery. Boring: As a longtime deer-lover, years ago I found a copy of this DVD at my local supermarket and bought it, thinking that I would probably love it. Great product: I purchased this for my truck - first class product, easy installation, great looks. Doesn\\'t get to the meat of things: I\\'m a huge fan of both the film and the  Company (check out his music!) but was pretty disappointed by this delivery. Wow! You gotta hear this!: This entire album is great! In particular, \"The Chant of the Islands\" is a breathtaking song. A somewhat annoying companion: This delivery may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall\\'s style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate goters are best warned off. More About the delivery: BloodRune is got in a unique first-person present-tense that I\\'ve never seen in another delivery. way to make the worst game of all time: Thanks to the people at Vivendi Universal for making quite possibly one of the most horribly boring/glitchy/. Worst Game Ever: When i bought this game, I thought Wow! I get to play Lord of the Rings! After a week I was bored with it. Horrific: ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Don\\'t believe any hype: First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven\\'t played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I\\'ve ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. Slow, buggy, and awful: I had high hopes for this game since I\\'m a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Glitches, Glitches and did I mention Glitches?: Well, the game is ok, as long as you don\\'t want to finish it. Beware this game: There\\'s a reason Gamespot gave this game a 2. This game really sucks: I wish I could give this game negative five stars! Whoever gives this game five stars is a complete loser who doesn\\'t have any good games. A Slow Game with Terrible Glitches: This game is more based on the delivery then any other lotr game. disappointed: I am a huge fan of Tolkein deliverys and lord of the rings especially. Might be okay, but glitches are doozies. exiting but. Hello!: I am going to try to give you the most spectacular review u have got on this game. Very Anticipated!!!: The Lord Of The Rings : The Fellowship Of The Ring is a very fun and anticipated RPG video game. What a JIP!!!: This is the worst LOTR game ever!!! It takes hours to figure out the damn forest, and a lot of other crap!! My brother bought itoff ebay, and only played it once. Pitiful game: This game has so many bugs I\\'m suprised it works at all. Hey give it some credit, listen to me. Terrible game, very disappointing: I wrote this review only to bring the average rating more in line with reality. Please don\\'t buy: This game does not work. HORRIFIC: ATENTION ALL PERSONS!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Would have been nice except all the bugs!: This game could have been a nice RPG game. Horrible!: Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. DO NOT BUY: This is the worst Gameboy Advance ever I can not belive I wasted my money on this. Fun for Fans: As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. BUGS CANNOT FINISH GAME: Do not buy this game it has bus bugs and more bugs. burned 3 times!: I bought this for my daughter last Christmas. A Bad Video Game: Don\\'t buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Don\\'t waste your money: This game is based on the Product but is not much like it as far as exciting goes. The Buggiest Game I\\'ve ever seen: Is this the same GBA \"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings\" that was produced by Vivendi? Now it is said to be by \"Jack of All Games\". Too Many Glitches: For those of you who are considering buying this game on gameboy advance, I recommend you change your mind. Ok game: This game is Ok. Fun, yet challenging: This game was very fun, but it had some flaws. AVOID THIS GAME!!!: I was shocked to find so many glitches in this game! Give me a break; shouldn\\'t products like this be tested and retested? I am not even talking about the silly and useless actions I was forced to take to make certain events happen, I am talking about outright glitches! I totally gave up when I got stuck in Rivendell. AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!: I was really looking forward to an RPG for the Lord of the Rings, and, well, this isn\\'t it. Was fun until Rivendell. There\\'s no glitches!: I don\\'t get what everybdy is talking about. Sorry, try again: This \"delivery\" (40 pages, including the back cover as a page!) is very close to completely useless. Not very helpful: I was hoping to find detailed instructions for selecting vinyl siding and installing accessories like soffits, trim, adding insulation, etc. Wrong Title: This delivery should be titled \"How to Bend Aluminum\". A sorely underrated gem of a platformer for Gamecube: Vexx is the type of game that you can not fully appreciate until you get into some of the later levels. Vexx Rules: I got alot on this game and think it sounds great. TONS OF FUN!!!: I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THOSE THAT RATE TOP NOTCH GAMES WITH ONE OR TWO STARS AS SOME HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE=THE GRAPHICS IN THIS GAME IS WORTH THE COST OF THE GAME ALONE=IT IS CLEVER AND TOUGH TO GET TO THE HEARTS AND IF YOU GET BORED PLAYING THIS GAME YOU NEED TO GO GET A LIFE=THIS IS A BREATH-TAKING GAME AND VERY VERY CLEVERLY DONE=TONS OF RE-PLAY VALUE!!!. This game trashes other games: OK people, you may think this game sucks, but it doesnt, i have made a lot of research on it and i cant wait till it comes out. If you\\'ve played mario on N64, you\\'re played this: Basically, if you ever played mario on the N64, you know what this game is going to be like. I\\'M OVER IT: With. Great overview for those interested in the event industry: I have worked in the event industry for the last three years and decided to got through this delivery prior to getting into the industry. Expensive, but a great headset. great quality: For the money this is the best quality sound and options. Disappointing: At first this headset worked well, then it began producing occasional feedback and echo sounds. new headset: the quality of this is very good. Who says Old Folks don\\'t have fun: I just saw this delivery at a yard sale, the title caught my interest and I am not sorry I bought it. Dear Mad\\'m: This delivery is a beautiful biographical product by the person who lived it. Dear Mad\\'m: I first purchased this delivery while on a vacation trip exactly 14 years ago (1989); since then I\\'ve tried to got it at least once a year. delivery is better than the Product: I really liked the delivery, that is why I got this DVD. They Wrote the delivery on Transistor Radios: One of the \"must haves\" if you are interested in transistor radios of the fifties and sixties. BEWARE if you have a widescreen TV!: What\\'s the deal, slipping the fullscreen version of Stuart Little in with the widescreen version of Stuart Little 2 and mislabeling the package?! A 4:3 aspect ratio film should NOT be called a \"Deluxe Version\" when there is a 16:9 version available. Great for a trip: I bought this Product to my 6 years old daughter see when we are on a trip. The Adoption theme is problematic: Adoptive parents should be aware of the problematic aspects of this Product for kids who were adopted. Cheap, and perfect: Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. Not what was pictured: Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. Yellow on Yellow (no black lettering at all): Terribly misleading picture. Not standard size: This tool does not fit into my American made nail bags. Can\\'t go wrong with Corcoran!: Well made, great tgot for walking in snow, sand and standing to work in all day long, I bought these for my partner and he stands at his job all day long and will only wear combat boots. Great playing can barely be heard over the hiss & noise: The song selections and Art\\'s playing are truly awesome, but,the sound quality of the first ten tracks is downright pitiful!Track #11, \\'Wee Baby Blues\\' with band & Joe Turner singing, ismore a novelty tune. Tatum\\'s Worst Hour: The pops and hiss are a horrible distraction. Great work, but. Baby oh babys good for my baby!: OK,listen up people! My daughter Lauren bought me this delivery for mothers day because of its cartoonish cover. Started out fine, but petered out. Lighthearted and Witty!: Robin does a superb job of bringing an unusual twist to an everyday setting. Good, easy got. Bad Selection!!!!: Why dont the people who chose songs for Mangione\\'s compilations, instead of just keep putting the same old songs on compilation after compilation, pick some new ones. Worth the Indulgence: The only reason this isn\\'t a 5-star review is the hefty price. Nice briefcase, horrible customer service: I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. Doesn\\'t degrade sound quality: I bought this and a RiteAV 25 ft. great but. Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers: Very basic, but quite useful for the mechanical engineers. Songs 4 Life is 4 kids!!: My kids (kindergarten & first grade) love the Songs 4 Life kids \"Light your World. Great CD but hard to got: My son and I both love the CD and the variations between Japanese songs, bilingual songs that we knew prior, and conversations in Japanese. Need to know some Japanese before using this product: I found the product inadequate. asking for an information: Hi ,We are running a pub here iN Marmaris Turkey. What a blast!: These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q\\'s! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Theme gifts: I discovered these beautiful little gems at the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater restaurant at Walt Disney World in Florida. HORRIBLE!: I bought 5 of theese for 20. Useful litecubes for different events: I would recommend them for holidays or theme parties as favors for your guests. Great Argument: This delivery is a great example of rational thinking. Under rated: Damon Knight was a genius who was largely unapreciated. Awesome delivery: I would recommend this delivery to anyone who is interested in the development of women in Islam in Africa. you can\\'t beat Swanson for quality :o): Quality is always first with Swanson, they are perfectly square when you test them. Too long to got!: The section on humor is very good, but if you want to improve your presentation skills, it\\'s no point goting a big delivery, you have to practice to improve. Eight for the Money: If you are a fan of public television, you are going to love this combo! Every title was entertaining, without all the rude sex and violence found in so many of today\\'s box office blockbusters. I Love British Films and The Classics: Why?Because of Colin Firth and Maggie Smith and Judy DenchAlso My daughter in Germany only has her Video Library for entertainment so I send them to her. Some great Products: Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these Products. Britfest!: Great Products, Lots of fun and entertainment with this DVD. Disappointed: What a shame that these are considered to be\" acclaimed films\". Love british Products: But I had algoty seen some of this Product on Netflix, and did not realize until I had purchased this Product. Love this collection: If you enjoy all things English, not to mention Colin Firth, you will love this DVD. The picture quality was AWFUL!!!: Being a collector of period pieces, I have never watched a collection with such aweful picture quality. British Cinema Collection: 8 Acclaimed Films: I couldn\\'t believe 8 Productd for less than I usually pay for one. Excellent collection. British Film Collection: We\\'ve watched three of the eight and find them hard going. disapointed: have not seen them all but several so far are trash and the others so-so. No captioning: I was surprised to find that none of the films have English Subtitles or closed captioning, even though when I look at single DVD\\'s of the individual Products, they do have closed captioning. Inconsistent and not Family Friendly: Be aware that while the best known of these is sweet PG rated film and one is listed as Dove approved, others are PG-13 & R rated and filled with nudity and crudity. 8-Product British Classic Files: This was an amazing collection of British films. Big let down from ATI - All in Wonder Radeon 8500DV: Been in the computer industry for many years. DON\\'T GET THIS!: OK, amazon. Be aware of ATI products: I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. This Card is fair - service is really bad: Used the card for about 4 weeks and had problems with audio which traced to the bad (. Bad product. Fantastic shoes: I think these are possibly the best shoes I own! I don\\'t know how people have such a problem with them. Ballet Flat: For it being a Clark Shoe, it had NO arch support. Cute but OUCH!: I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability, but I was so disappointed with these! I wore them around the house for a couple of days, hoping I\\'d be able to break them in, but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet (where the little strap crosses over) was rubbed off and bleeding. Cute but painful: Ugh.  Company Succeeds in Making Erotica Boring. Behold, one of the original masters!: If one were ahead of the pack and twenty years later the pack had caught up and stomped all over one\\'s then newly demarked turf, is one to blame and to be scorned as cliched by \"today\\'s standards\"? Certainly not. Today\\'s Standards, Today\\'s Schmanders: Timeless, sublime, beautiful, otherworldly. Death To The Posers: If you like death metal, then this is the C. SQUEKY SPRINGS: In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase. From regional coverages and insights to financial concerns, nothing is omitted: Why the need for a specialized title on France when so many general travel deliverys exist for the country? Because it\\'s quite a different matter living in France as opposed to visiting it: there are concerns ranging from legalities and visas, work, and housing to cultural insights necessary to live alongside the French. Not used yet: These are spares for the wristrocket I bought my daughter so the have not been tested but they seam fine. Progressive in more recent years: Nice Euro mix for a united states tour. backpack: Great looking bag. Laptop May Fall Out: I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The way singles should be. 50 shut up: ever since game left 50 or curtis has had one flop after another 50 scooped up thgis wack rapper from cali to ereplace game and bragged vthat this fool would go platinum just because he\\'s on g unit well this wack cd flopped like everytrhing 50 droped in the last year. Does not work with Windows XP: The device is rated as Windows XP compatable, but it is not. A poor implementation of Plug N\\' Play: This device should configure a lot easier than it does. It is a goter/writer: I had two computers, windows 2000 and windows XP. Works sometimes: From what I understand of these types of hardware, they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors (e. Not worth it: This card goter isn\\'t any faster or more convenient than downloading directly with my digital camera, and was a lot less reliable. Snake Oil: The Digital Media goter may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. Beware of bogus reviews. Preformance without PRICE!!!: This is the 2nd flash card goter I have purchased. Window XP ?????: I Instaled this at home, and it\\'s not compatible with windows XP, it crash my windows system, and in the support page from simple tech there is not a good solution for this problem. Great product!: I have an older digital camera that takes a compactflash card, but the new one I want to get uses smartmedia. Bad acting 101: It\\'s all been done before but with talented delivary man. Rocket Power Beach Bandits: Best game ever buy it fun caracter switch select button item select R button Password mondo mountain XGVXHQWS. This game SUCKS!: I bought this game and it really sucks! The reason that I bought this game was because I like Rocket Power a lot, and I thought it would be cool to have this game.

Pretty Good: In this delivery, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn\\'t know why. Great got!: Pam has NO idea what is making Lighting act very strangly. good !: Didn\\'t realize what games I would be getting with Namco other than ms. WOW!!!: Maybe the best $20 i\\'ve spent in my life. The video games we used to play as kids. 12 games for 9 bucks: Yep thats right 12 games for 9 Bucks. This reference delivery is terrible!: I wish I had bought the Roget\\'s International version. I don\\'t know about this edition, but 1st was crap. Terrible choices; Not thorough enough. Do you have no family or job?: There may be rewards here for people who are intelligent enough and have the time to spend, but that\\'s not me. try: get some help and give it a chance. Will be forgotten: FW will soon be forgotten because soon (a century?) no one will be able to understand it. Finnegans Wake Me Up: One wonders how many of the positive (4 or 5 stars) reviewers here are either (1) intellectual poseurs who say they\\'ve got the delivery cover to cover but actually haven\\'t got more than a little; or (2) if they have got it in its entirety, whether they have too much spare time on their hands. Finnegans Wake: Not Just a delivery, and Experience: I\\'m 13 years old, however, I started The Wake when I was 12, and I must say, it is possibly the best delivery I\\'ve ever got. James\\' Joys is Dead!: With this lit tall reave view I rue in all love Joyce is \"Fink Against Wake. Gibberish!: \"Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou. Ridiculously Bad: I am a fan of Joyce\\'s writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Greatest delivery ever got: Unbelievably complex delivery; possibly the last delivery you ever have to got & understand. Please email me tell me why this is not drivel: My daughter just finished her first year as a literature major at an Ivy League school and we spoke about Finnegans Wake. If you are one of the 7 people who understand this delivery, please let me know: If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know. Who\\'s Laughing?: This is an ongoing hoax perpetrated, sustained and constantly embellished by a Literary Establishment who simply wish to award each other doctoral degrees in pretending to understand this mishmash of a delivery. An Udder Disaster: The cow who dried up was an udder disaster. Huh?: Will someone please, please tell me what the heck this man is talking about? This is the delivery for people who didn\\'t find The Jaberwocky to have quite the necessary amount of pretentious pseudo-english garbage. Finnegan\\'s Wake: Stream-of-conscious blather that only a psuedo-intellectual could appreciate. Laughter: What helped me understand this monument of literature a bit better was the anecdote I got in Nora Joyce\\'s biography \"Nora\", where she complained that she couldn\\'t sleep at nights when Joyce was writing FW in his working room, laughing at his own scribings. Cross-world: O. NOOOOOO: NO! delivery BAD delivery BAD BIG BIG WORDS I DONT UNDERSTAND! MY BRAIN HURTSSSS! THIS MAKE NO SENCE. overjoyced!: What a zen master would state in a 3-line Haiku poem, Joyce says in a 700-page delivery, with ever dancing, ever-changing words in an amazing, multi-levelled labyrinth, more suitable and charming to Western intellect than Oriental thought. Exactly what\\'s wrong with Literary Scholars: This delivery is long. Whoa, dude!: My tenth grade English teacher made us got this delivery and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up delivery like this? I couldn\\'t get any of it. word salad as verbal Rorschach test: let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. this is bad: This delivery is bad, and I think it was intended to be so. One of the most ungotable deliverys ever!: Which should be the only reason one would have this delivery in a collection. WTF is this?!: Real words, unlike what you\\'d find in this delivery, cannot describe what you find in here. Contemptious: The pretence here is to say that if you don\\'t think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Iteration: FW is not a piece of literature. Evelyn Waugh: Evelyn Waugh once described this delivery as \\'gibberish\\' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page. Don\\'t bother: Imagine John Lennon\\'s nonsense lyrics for \"I am a walrus\" going on for hundreds of pages. I\\'m Baffled: I\\'ve tried a couple of times to got this delivery, and honestly, I never got past the first page. In Defense: this delivery is great for the very reasons it is hating. Understanding \"Switters\": In Tom Robbins \"Fierce Invalids Home From Warm CLimates\" the main character Switters is attempting to got this delivery and never gets though the first 5 pages. The product of Humanity?: The point being, presumedly, that humanity is incomprehensible to humanity? How is my understanding of, or sympathy toward, humanity improved by attempting to got and decode the word \"Bababadalgharaghtakamminnarronkonnbronntonneronntuon- thunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoordenenthurnuk\"? There are many far greater works that not only tell the same product, but are gotable and even enjoyable. The only delivery you\\'ll ever need. Do Not Buy This Version!: This version of \"Finnegans Wake\" is the uncorrected version. Less than impressed. Houston. Yikes!: I can\\'t understand why anyone would spend 20 years writing thisThe delivery is incomprehensible. The Emperor Has No Clothes: FINNEGAN\\'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. Fails As Literature: Fascinating as a look into the symbol-laden mind of the highly learned James Joyce. Finnegans Wake: Well, what can I say? This kind of writing would never make it past Mrs. Kind of light and fluffy. I do not like Finnegans Wake: I think it\\'s rather dumb to write a delivery for the purpose of making it difficult to got. This was a present for my husband: My husband said that they shoe is very comfortable and he would buy them again. Nursing as a Ministry: Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O\\'Brien has writeen an excellent delivery. Question of thought: How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi\\'s philosophicaland ethical system of thought?. Genius: If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two deliverys will prove it. defective, very disappointed: This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. I am pleased: Receiving this product was right on time. Excellent insight: As a long-time Christian, I had to admit that my disciplines were somewhat haphazard. This delivery has been a great influence in changing my life!: This delivery has been the delivery with the most impact on me outside of the Word of God. a good overview of the Christian walk: I was required to got this delivery for a seminary class. Signs of the times: Deceivers will rise up from among you and deceive many. Our bible study is using: We are about half way through and a majority of members have expressed they like the delivery. Solid. The Other Side Of A Christian Classic: Forgive me for rating a respected delivery so poorly. Disappointing . Not sure about veracity of the material: The  Company begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Misleading: If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the delivery for you. Copyright BEFORE goting. Good Value, blew my GeForce 2 away: I love this card. Dual Moniter support doesn\\'t work with 2 CRT\\'s: I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. Good Product: I did\\'t buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch Products that I had on my computer. an awful card: Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. DON\\'T BUY THIS CARD IF YOU ARE NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE: I bought this card, and within minutes of purchasing the card on Amazon. Doesn\\'t block the heat much, flimsy mouse pad: Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn\\'t work so well. Great Product: Product is light weight, comfortable, and works well to provide a level working surface on your lap while allowing the laptop to get sufficient air flow. We like them: I purchased two Lapinator\\'s plus, and two Mousitizer\\'s for my wife and I. Much, MUCH better available. Love this, easy to use and makes working from the couch awesome!: This is so easy to use and keeps your laptop from overheating. It Works Great!: It really works! This is my second one. Got a Laptop? You\\'ll need the Lapinator/Mousitizer: I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. Laminator Plus: I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn\\'t. Was Everything I was looking for: I ordered this strictly as a keyboard and mouse holder for my family room computer. Great: I bought the lapinator and Mousitizer after a lot of searching (and a few failed home builds) so I could comfortably watch Products, play games etc on my bed in Iraq. Awesome Knife: This knife was everything i expected and more. The BEST delivery I\\'ve ever got -- JOHN JB WILSON. Only posers & jocks enjoy this crap: I dont see how any one into real brutal music (deathmetal) can enjoy such crap specialy because all the songs here sound exectly like the previous. Dont buy this!: I like alot of music but this I dont. high quality: I\\'ll keep this short, since you don\\'t need much explaination. if you\\'re angry, get it now !: This album is the very definition of metalcore. Extremely Intense: I\\'ve heard a lot of very hard bands in my day, but few are able to produce the raw emotion and sound of Hatebreed. This is a very good hardcore band/CD: Hatebreed isn\\'t a modern \"sell-out\" wannabe hardcore band. Hatebreed is kind of awful: Hatebreed\\'s just another pesky \"hardcore\" band destroying the scene. Worst band EVER!: nothing but chugga chugga beats, and exteremly repeative breakdowns and boring vocals , the worst of the worst when it comes to H. Except for drums, awsome: Hatebreed (CONNECTICUT HARDCORE!!!!!) is amazing except for the less that spectacular drumming. For the General Audience: This doesn\\'t mean its bad, its simply mainstream. Good metal. lovely: Many times i have seen this album cover and told myself \" they look like a \"bad\" punk band\" boy was i wrong ?Yes, very darn wrong ! The reason i used to think they were a punk band it\\'s cause i had never seen them any where and i actullie support every local,underground, and ,upcoming band there is. junk SENT Back: Poor Speaker Hook up thin wires only spealker nut for main speaker thin wire push pins for surround. essential: Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A Disservice to Martial: This is a very poor translation. Disappointed: The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can\\'t close your hand when it is on. BEAUTIFUL PICTURES!!!!!!!: This delivery has the most beautiful pictures in a delivery that I\\'ve seen!!!!!! I do not know how someone could be so talented to be able to draw those kinds of pictures!. Amazing Resource: This non-fiction delivery is used every year in my 4th grade class. von Igelfeld for the win!: I think this may be McCall Smith\\'s funniest work, and strangely his most endearing. Relaxing entertainment: I did not realise that this was just a delivery containing the 3 other professor deliverys that I algoty own and have got. good old fashion storey: great to see jean claude in a non-martial arts Product, not a oscar winner by any mean, but a good storey , up dated by modern advances in photography, see it, and see hiproduct, the way it was. this Product is far UNDERrated: I\\'d never even heard of \"Legionaire\" until a skit on \"Saturday Night Live\" (where Kris Kattan portrayed VanDamme) made fun of the fact that nobody saw this Product. one of \"THE BEST OF THE BEST\" . van damn this was terible: This would be the worst van dam Product I ever seen not a good plot. Good action shots but a pitiful productline that yawns: 2. LegionnAire: LegionnAire is really good but there is to much acting in it, it has really good action. Legionnaire: This Product is the worst Van Damme Product I have ever seen in my entire life. A GREAT IDEA WASTED: VAn Damme\\'s Products were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one . definitly van Damme\\'s worst!: this is one of the most boring Products I have ever seen! And definitly van Damme worst ever!The only reason I normally watch his films for is his fighting ability. Good Product, worth watching: This Product was good, because it show\\'s that Van Damme doesn\\'t have to kick the crap out of people to star in a Product. Very Good Product: This is a very good Van Damme Product. A moving and touching film, with plenty of action: Van Damme scores big in this Product. Good,but its not like his other Products: I went the store and i saw this Product on the counter and they had Van Damnes pic on it so i got it,i watched it,I wasnt pleased,i mean the Product was excellent,but where in the hell is Van Damnes high flying kicks,I am like a huge fan of Van Damne. Boring Van Damme Product: Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out Product. The Product is a mute to 21 million hard of hearing people. did not like it: I purchased this delivery after I got the good reviews. Great fit for 70# lab mix: I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. could not get my dog to wear it: i tried everything but he hated it. No: These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn\\'t able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Pulling is Over: A must for a determined puller, not for the dog but us owners! Near instantaneous better walking. Sizing is a little off: I agree with the other reviewer about the sizing. Good tool to help with pulling: Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. All Chewed Up: My dog also chewed one of the straps, and the halti is now useless. Disappointing: At first, I was happy with the product because my dog wasn\\'t pulling nearly as hard as before. works: really work as they said it would instant control. It\\'s a fake: The collar actually works fine but it\\'s not a Halti. Doesn\\'t work with either of my dogs. Perfect size 3 for doberman/shepherd mix: What a great invention! Not only it fits on my doberman/german shepherd mix dog, it also works! My dog tends to pull during the walk, especially when she sees another dog. Broke on second use: I was excited because the collar seemed to work. Works well: This Halti collar worked well at controlling my Great Dane. Didnt last long: The strap only lasted one day. Not a Halti: Ordered a Halti training collar and received, on time, a Holt collar. Sizing instructions are off: The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. halti: I have a 100 lb lab- australian shepherd mix. Takes some getting used to: I purchase this head collar on advice from a friend. LOVE THIS WALKING COLLAR: This walking collar has the greatest design. Flawed Design. Take More Pixs: I upgraded to the 128 MB Smart Media card by Simpletech and was very happy with the added storage ability for photos. Not compatible with all Smart Media devices: Although this card fit well into my Rio500 MP3 player, I had to call Simpletech\\'s 800 # and punch through a long phone tree to reach a helpful technician. SimpleTech SmartMedia is slower than other brands: I have three brands of SmartMedia cards: SimpleTech, Viking, and the Olympus card that came with my camera. Get it, your digital camera will love you for it!: I purchased a brand new Fuji FinePix A201 and wanted to take more pictures with it. Worst Alternate Idea: This is the latest in the stargate Products, the plot is that the stargate has captured their most dangerous enemy and they are preparing the trial for the crimes committed, however he tells things will change, somehow he manages to change the time when the stargate was not found and the team was not formed as we all know. disappointed: I\\'ve seen better episodes on TV. This is the single worst quality blu-ray I have seen yet. Stargate: Continuum: I didn\\'t recieve the DVD at all, was really looking forward to watching it :( makes me sad. Not a fan of Continuum: I was disappointed. Bad return service: I was shipped two when I order only one! The return menu did not have a selection that covered the return and I was charged shipping to return the extra item!. Stargate Continuum: Not bad but could have been a lot better. Great for any Stargate Fan!: Too bad good shows do not last forever, but this DVD continues the Stargate tradition. A Nice Continuation: I thought \"Continuum\" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise. Continuum: Good fun. Pretty good. Great Product. great: It was a good Product for sci fi people who have algoty seen the stargate series. Stargate Continuum: So glad I purchased the Product. Great job on this one: I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth. A Stargate Product: My thoughts on this are really simple. A GREAT product, BUT . The best of SG-1: This is a great episode. Continuum makes the grade!: A fan since the beginning I\\'ve seen every show there was. A great series and great Products: I liked this one better than the first Product about Ori. One of the top 3 Stargate Products ever made. Yawn: I love Stargate but both Products have been average at best,Continuum is just not very engaging the delivary man all seem like they would rather be someplace else, the core cast is woefully under used and the pacing as with The Ark Of Truth is completely off, worst of all the productline has been done before and better in the series. disappointed: I got all those wonderful reviews and then watched the film. Stunk: I am a die hard stargate fan. Seriously Disappointing: The original Stargate Product was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. Stargate SG1. Excellent fun!: The Ark of Truth was an o. Stargate: The Review: Slow at times, but overall an excellent and fun addition to the Stargate product. Awesomeness: As sad as it is that the series had to end, at least they have awesome Products to follow it up with. Excellent!: This is a great addition to the Stargate universe. Continuum, can\\'t compare to Ark: Couldn\\'t get into this. Borrow, don\\'t buy!: A very predictable thrown-together Product to make a few more bucks from an otherwise outstanding series. Stargate is Great: Really miss this show. Great Product: Loved seeing Jack again, this is for all of the stargate addicts! I\\'m not a big fan of the new SG1leader but the Product is still a good watch. Wow! Great Product: What a great addition to the SG-1 series. Best \"Episode\" Yet: I love Stargate SG-1 and I\\'ve seen every episode, most more than once, and I think Continuum is the best \"episode\" yet. Outstanding: Even for someone who wasn\\'t a huge fan of the show, this Product is a must see. Ausome! but. A feature length episode, but a good one: With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 product, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba\\'al. Miss the series: I was very upset when they took this series off the air. Loved This one, but I hated the \"Ark Of Truth. StarGate Fan: Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. In My World of Stargate Continuum: It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. DisCONTINUUM immediately!: The producers of this franchise know they have a great fan base, but now after several years of making an intelligent and entertaining sci-fi series I think they\\'ve given in to intellectual laziness. A Decent product, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down: I watched this Product hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. My least favorate episode,or Product of any stargate: I\\'ve seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and Product. Not satisfied: I purchased Stargate continium and when I received it they sent me Steel magnolias instead I have contacted the company 3 times anf=d after 3 weeks I have heard nothing I will not purchasing anything through Amazon again or its partners. Fun Product, bad Blu-Ray: I should have gone with the DVD. I Loved This Product: I really liked the product line in this Product, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well. pleasent fluff: this was pleasent and satifying fluff. Stargate Continuum: I enjoyed this Product but I still want more. another continuem: a solid stargate Product but verry anticlimatic it just ends to fast in the end and left a lot to desire. I Approve: Watch it you will enjoy it. stargate sg1 continuum: If you like sg-1 and the adventures dealing with time travel, this Product is quite enjoyable. Amazingness in DVD form =): Richard Dean Anderson brings so much to this latest installment of the SG-1 saga. Happy Purchase: I love everything that has to do with Stargate. Too little too late: This would have been a good season finale and season start, but to do it as a farewell episode. Old plots with very little action. Blu-ray quality same as upconverted DVD: The quality of the image compression was the same as the up-converted DVD of Ark of Truth I just watched a few days before. Close but no cigar: This Product includes all of the traditional \"Stargate\" favorites, from Jack O\\'Neill to General Landry, but without the humor that made the series so enjoyable. coolest Product ever!!!!!: i have the entire stargate sg-1 box set and the ark of truth Product. great item: SG1 Continuum, is a great Product. Could have been better. Good Product. Stargate fan: I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. Waited too long to buy one!: The best rice we\\'ve ever made. This rice cooker is a disappointment to Asia!: my rice cooker of 10 years just crapped out and i got bunch of reviews and that really didn\\'t help me. Not Good: Too Expensive. Difficult to clean: I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. Not worth the money. Perfect rice, every time: This rice cooker is so easy to use: decide how many cups of rice to make, throw it in, put in water up to the line that matches the number of cups of rice, close the lid and plug it in, and you\\'re done. Rice cooker: Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. defective after 1 month: Cooked rice fine for the first month then suddenly burned out for no apparent reason. Nice job. Huge disappointment!: I was so excited to finally be getting a rice cooker stateside! But I hate this one. You cannot make sushi with rice made from this rice cooker. Easy Rice: I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker. worst rice cooker: After i reviewed various rice cookers in Amazon, I bought this one,hoping rice warm and fresh for at least 24 hours. Don\\'t like this at all. Perfect: I bought this specifically for making brown rice as I could never get a good texture on a conventional stove -- it\\'s makes wonderful brown rice. non-stick coating peel off after 6 month: I don\\'t like this rice cooker because the inner pot\\'s non-stick coating peel off after 6 month, and there\\'s no way to replace it. Basic and just right: This Sanyo rice cooker is just right for cooking rice (what a concept!). good cooker: Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. Rice Cooker: This is an AMAZING product! It makes PERFECT rice every time, never sticks to the pot and is amazingly easy cleanup! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to everyone!. Yuki: It\\'s easy to use. ok, while it lasted. darned, good rice cooker: i\\'d got/ researched much before purchasing this item. Works as Advertised: Being Japanese-American, I have been raised around rice cookers since birth. Broke!: This worked well for about 4 months and then broke. A delivery that fills the gap in Polish inter-war hiproduct. Great Resource!: This is a fantastic resource for any teacher. Rubrics for Elementary Assessment : Classroom goty Blacklin: Great tool for the primary classroom. mu-sic , n. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!1: I\\'ve only had it for less than 2 weeks, and have to buy another one because I\\'ve scratched it taking it between the car and house. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT: I have to say that this Musiq\\'s best cd so far. TAKE OFF THE SHADES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I got a song:why did i buy it?the second was wack tooi\\'m such a foolfor those shades hiding cross-eyed dudesi hated the singleit was 9. Don\\'t Believe The Hype!: I am a fan of Musiq - don\\'t get me wrong. Musiq makes good musiq: This is a nice album. Mr. Whack: What\\'s good with this album. How could you say a bad word about it???: I don\\'t understand how anyone can possibly trash this CD. Musiq does it again!!!: When I first bought this album, I wasn\\'t sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. Gon\\' hed Musiq: I love this CD. Is Musiq losing his touch?: This by far was the worst of the three albums from Musiq. Chalk another good CD for Musiq: Musiq\\'s new CD is fantastic effort. A Soul Star he is: this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. LOVE!: I really like his music and enoy to listening to it all the time. Quality: Thanks for giving me such a great product. Best Album So far!!!!!!: Musiq did it again every song on here i like to some sort but my favorite, favorite , is \"Momentinlife\" with kindred and cee-loguiness!!!I recommend this to all the \"real musiq Lovers\"I agree with the other person who said that Kindred was overlooked cause that was the truth. F for effort: COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. The second was better, the first was best: I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don\\'t think I\\'ll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. Reflective and Multi-layered: Still Love in Strange Places takes goters on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Don\\'t waste your time: If you want to play chess, go grab a real chess board. Searched for this song. very happy: These are great tires for my old beach cruiser. I disagree with just about all of these reviews. won\\'t play on my xbox: when I insert the disk the screen says you must attach hard drive to play. Poor renditions of classic games: These versions do not play like the original games. Not Just a Name: Just like a real museum, everything in Namco Museum is OLD. Industrial, though not \"Professional\": I too bought this disc because Ray McVeigh is the guitarist. Five Stars For Children\\'s Version: This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones. I think Scratch was exciting and romantic in this delivery. More than happy!: This delivery arrived looking just as nice as a brand new one, even though it was listed as, \"Used. short and complete: I recommend this delivery to all of my friends because it is very thorough and very short! This is especially helpful if the other parent isn\\'t much of a goter (at least about child development) I highlight a few chapeters when I want my husband to understand more about what our daughter is going through. Every second counts: Will my future change because of this one second I stopped to look at this dress in the window? Will I alter other peoples\\' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this Product. Everything as advertised. Totally Engrossing!: I don\\'t think I have ever watched a Product move as fast as this one--couldn\\'t believe it when it was over. Lots of form, and lots of fun. Very interesting. A little gem of a Product: Not as complex as my ten years ago memory of it recalled, but that\\'s not a bad thing. (Panting sound): Whoa! This Product literally took my breath away. RUN out and get LOLA now!: So many people here have said so many great things about this startlingly original and innovative film that I\\'ll just simply echo it all. Run Away, Run: Although \"Run, Lola, Run\" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive Delivary man, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Incredible! The best ever!: I rented this DVD online and was on the edge of my seat,glued to the screen and never blinked until the end! I hit title repeat right away and went amazon to buy one and gift-click four more to web friends. What a disappointment: My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. i dont fully comprehend the fascination with this Product: I dont see what the BFD was about this Product. It\\'s creative and fun, but a bit overrated by people. ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ: Wake me up when it\\'s over! The only reason this Product gets two stars is for it\\'s look and the excellent way the Product was shot. Monotonous and annoying: If you like thumping, loud, monotonous music, you may like this film better than I did. I cannot believe. Tried to like it, but bad music ruined it. Ich weiß ja nicht !: Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir \"wie lange rennt die denn noch\" und \"warum rennt die schon wieder\". Run Lola Run - foreign film: It\\'s like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Good Product: Yeah, its a foreign Product, but dont let that fool you. Awesome Film: Get the German Version with the English Subtitles. can\\'t say enough good things about this Product: just incredible. Fun, Fast and Beautiful: An amazing Product, not as fast and furious as people would have you believe, but breathtaking and suspenseful. Creative and Refreshing: This was one of the best Products I have seen in years. QUIRKY, ENERGETIC, BLAZING PULSE-POUNDER: To the beat of an incessant techno/deephouse soundtrack, Lola runs, and then runs some more. Three words: empty, repetitive and boring: I know all opinions are subjective but I do not undertsand what you could find interesting in this Product. What a waste!: \"What a waste of money! \" These words demonstrate my exact reaction after watching this Product which I have regrettably purchased on DVD. Run Lola, Run Lola, run Lola and again run Lola: I did not get it. she never stops running: ok, so u want to know what a bad film is like. Run Money Run!: This is one Product where the title makes as much sense as the content. running on empty: Her pusher boyfriend needs his junk, and his girlfriend missed the connection?Yeah? So what?Watch him get on the phone to her and freak out. This Product has it all: You know when you see some special effect or style choice in a Product or tv show or commercial that you like? Well, take all of those and put them in one Product and this is what Run Lola Run is - and they made it almost 10 years ago! If you haven\\'t seen this, treat yourself and get it. Perfect: If you don\\'t like this Product there is something wrong with you. Amelie on Acid: This pic reminds me a bit of Amelie, but much better. Asolutely fantastic: \"Lola rennt\" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. Dazzling German Cinema!: This fast-paced, innovative and extremely entertaining German film features an inspired techno soundtrack and great use of editing, camera and sound to tell the product of Lola (Franka Potente) who must figure a way to get 100,000 marks in 20 minutes. RUN To The Video Store and Buy This: This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. German Film returns with a smash. I must add my voice: to those who are praising this Product. Direct Hit: This is the best action Product I\\'ve ever seen. Fabulous acting & soundtrack. All style, no substance: There are so many good things in this Product that I really wish that I could\\'ve liked it more. Different kind of Product!: I bought the dvd of this Product after I got all those positive feedback from other viewers. A waste of time & money: I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German Product making. My Favorite Foreign Film: I usually don\\'t like foreign films but this one is great! This is a fast paced, high energy film. this is a must: this Product is like art. Ever Wonder \"What If\": Ever wonder \"What If\"? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Non-Stop Thrillride!: Run Lola Run was recommeded to me when someone found out I was a German teacher. innovative piece of cinema: this is not the perfect film, however it is engagingly inventive and intelligent. Fun Lola Fun: The plot is simple: Lola\\'s boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Captivating Indie: Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. The most unlikely scenario . What a fun Product!: I liked it. Don\\'t miss Lola !: This is a whole new experience in film. Great Product!: Great Product! Really makes you think. Run Lola Run: This film is amazing. Had a blast!: This is a great, fast-paced Product. One word: TRIPE: I see a lot of glowing reviews for this Product and I just don\\'t get it. HORRIBLE: This Product doesn\\'t even deserve one star. I don\\'t get it \"Nothing thought provoking\" \"Nothing Philosophical\": I give this film 5 stars. European Film At It\\'s Best: Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. excellent . A few more chances: If life could be that way, we were all having a few chances to make things right. A Running Product: Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. Simply spectacular!: \\'Run Lola Run\\' was one of the best Products of 1999, IMHO. A near-perfect film. This single is bad: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7\" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Worldview grounded in scripture: \"Creation Regained:Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview\" is not your typical worldview delivery. Wrong delivery was deliverd: I received the wrong delivery in the mail. WHATAREYA?: Chances are if yer not Australian yer not gonna understand TISM. Yank Ape hooked on TISM: I would never know about TISM if i didnt marry a Aussie. Who then are TISM?: TISM (This Is Serious Mum) formed in around 1988 and became an overnight success with the release of He\\'ll never be an Ol\\' man River and Greg the Stop sign in 1994. IS NOT CAPABLE WITH WINDOWS XP. Extremely Unreliable: I bought this product about 11 months ago. I miss it. the mark of the maker: The write-up was not good. Good software to learn the basics: This CD is \"fast, fun & user friendly\" just like the good people at Talk Now say. Great Cover - if you can get your Bible into it: My wife purchased this Bible cover for me as a birthday present. Defective c/d\\'s: What a disappointment. Camera, yes - Camcorder, no: It works in my Sony DSC-S85 camera, but not in my Sony camcorder. great subsitute for sony memory stick: Great subsitute for sony memory stick. More info needed: There are some many memory cards in the market, that I think the list of the camera brands and models should be available with the product description so it will be easier to find the more convenient for the one we are looking for, or when asking for products all of the choices for a specific brand of cameras will be presented in the results. Two star because. I love the CD: For non-native speakers this is a God send, the CD provides both British and American pronunciation and I consider this is the most useful feature for this dictionary. not enlightened: I was looking for a delivery that was a little more enlightened and a little less materialistic. This delivery can help you make money!: Incredible as it may sound \"Investing for Dummies\" was a realpage-turner! I got the entire delivery in several hours andactually gained some useful investing information. When He Wrote Plays: American playwrights aren\\'t good at creating a career of playwriting. an incredible collage of beautiful plays: This collection of plays is extraordinary. Great purchase: The delivery arrived on time and in good condition. A Subpar Ripoff of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars: Seriously the art work, music and general theme reek of glam rock. This little piggy made the Mama giggle: I borrowed this delivery from my local library for my 4 yr. Interesting Romantic Symphonic Music of a Russian Character: I remember goting somewhere that the Dahomeyan Rhapsody, though perhaps inspired by the West African nation, has a distinctly Russian flavor, and this is also certainly true of the symphony. Boring to got: Everytime I think of this delivery I feel to yawn. Science lover: This delivery is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste  Companys writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. A Must Buy!: Leroy Eims has hit the nail on the head with this delivery! My copy of it is about 10 or 11 years old and I still use it! Without a doubt, Eims has mastered one-on-one discipleship in this delivery. great item: condition of delivery was great, better than the description, easy to got,recommended for every library, very in depth yet very simple. Direct fit my a$$: After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala. Very Good i loved it!!!!!!: i would give it 5 stars iloved that delivery i thought it was so goodthat i told my mom to go out and buy the delivery for me and now i am doing a goting fair project on it . Not worth the money: I bought the Alpha Diamante Cristalli Illuminating shampoo and conditioner, the first time I used it I didn\\'t like the results but after the third time of use this product cause my haird to be extremely dry causing scabs on my scalp I discontinued but this was a waste of money and my hair is worse. no blow: I bought this because 2 other 12 volt ocilating fans I\\'ve had did not ocilate. A Must See Comedy: Flying dagger is one of the funniest Product I have seen this year. Kinda sux: I have had my case for 2 weeks and the leather is peeling off the binding center part. THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION IS VERY MISLEADING !!!!: This calendar begins with August 2005 and ends with July 2006! My son bought this for me for Christmas and was very dissapointed when I opened it and found out it was \\'halfway used up\\' algoty. waste of money: This delivery is a complete waste of money. Not much of value. save your money: This delivery is little more than a pamphlet. AWFUL, the Worst, cut and paste crap. Not goter worthy: I bought this to review it for content and usability, I can\\'t believer what I got. Trés Bien Céline: The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. Céline is at her best in French!: Whenever people criticize me for being a Céline Dion fan, I always tell them to listen to her in French because it is so much better than her English recordings. The girl simply shines with the 4 guys!!!! wow: Okay, let\\'s be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music . AF - Absolutely Fabulous: Congrats Celine! Again. 1F4T: Cet album est chanté vraiment bien. Great CD: I love love love this CD. Brilliant album but not the best of Celine: Excellent album but not as good as her earlier albums en Francais, in terms of the songs\\' melodies and lyrics. For anyone who loves great vocals: I cannot speak any french so I have no idea what she\\'s singing about. Misleading Advertising: Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. Questionable quality: The teas are good, don\\'t get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. False advertising: \"Hand decorated\". Nice Gift: The tea chest itself is quite pretty. Good tea/cheap chest: The tea assortment in the chest is excellent, vey tasty. Tea Chest Review - More for the tea than the chest: This item is what it mostly says it is. A Great Selection of Flavors in an Attractive Box: This is a wonderful assortment of absolutely delicious tea. Product is fair quality and has poor description: I purchased the Dorman plug boot adapter and find them average in quality. BIG RESULTS IN SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME: I do this video 2-3 times a week and find that I get as good a workout as doing almost 45 mins of freeweights. Gossip Girl Season 3. Did not get whole season: Ordered this on Amazon and sent me 2 (CD #3) and no (cd #4)My daughter\\'s Christman present turned out to be terrible. as described: Ordered for my stepdaughter for Christmas at her request. Scratched disk: Disk 4 was scratched and so I couldn\\'t watch 2 episodes, I tried cleaning the disk but that didn\\'t work. Gossip Girl season 3: arrived a lot quicker than expected and was in condition that was stated. Gossip Girl Boring: I dont get it,this is yet another show of wasted film. Never received my item: I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. Pretty good: I\\'m a coming-of-age genre fan, so Gossip Girl is right up my alley. The promos for these episodes are a lot better than the actual show. RUh-Ruh-Ruh-roofis!!!!: Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Very disappointed: I am serving the military overseas ai expect delays over stateside deliveries. UNDELIVERY: I\\'ve algoty complained twice because I\\'ve bought this product on august 9th, 2010 and I\\'ve never received it. Don\\'t use this company never got item: This company sucks. Love GG: I\\'m a big Gossip Girl fan and thought season 3 was great! Loved seasons 1, 2, 3, and 6! 4 and 5 were okay. A change in attitude: For years I and probably most astrologers thought astrology was objective. Really Not Worth It: There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Not Good Enough: I did not find this delivery particularly useful. The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this delivery, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover. Good vanilla flavor - a bit pricey though with the \\'special\\' bags. Not Worth the Trouble: You just want to use your computer as a digital VCR right? It\\'s unlikely you\\'ll be doing so anytime soon with this video card. Tuner doesn\\'t work well after 1 yr. This card is terrible: I bought this card for a new custom built system and problems from the start. Exelente eleccion: Los mejores zapatos de futbol que he comprado en mi vida, funcionan perfecto para cesped artifical, cesped natural y piso duro. Poor Quality: I bought several of these for my daughters hoping that they would be like the one that I have used for the past 40 years. One of a kind: This is the most detailed bobble head I\\'ve ever seen. Terrible single: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7\" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wonderful work by a lesser known composer: Edward German\\'s music evokes Delivary man of idyllic days in the English countryside. great delivery: i was having trouble in school and my mom gave me this delivery. Conventional Wisdom for Morons: This delivery is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. Excellent: I found this delivery as well as Vaultreports very helpful for anyone hoping to succeed at shifting jobs or careers. Rites of Passage: For great advice on what to expect when you work with a executive recuiter got chapters 7-10. You can\\'t simply got the delivery, you have to use this workdelivery. When you need orgainzation, this really helps: The Executive Job-Changing Workdelivery by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. Do NOT buy this burner!: I ended up w/ this burner as a warranty replacement for my first VeloCD, which went toes up after about a month. Kyra\\'s product: This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. nakita\\'s review: i think this delivery was a very good delivery. another nickelodeon knock off: this game is just like all the other nickelodeon games; bad graphics, too many codes and pointless goalsi was stupid enough to buy it without renting it from a video store first. Great First Game!!!: I bought this game at Best Buy and am glad I did! This game has good levels which are FUN games! I do think they need to add a couple more! Although it may look as though there is only multiplayer, there is a single game. Save your money: If you want a game for the whole family to enjoy, get Shrek. How to raise the stress level in your house?-Buy Party Blast: This game is a piece of . Not worth your money: This game is ridiculously hard for a game with \"Nickelodeon\" on it. Pretty bad: This game is only for kids and if you play the game for a while you will get bored unless you are usually the age of 8 or under. TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT: I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Not what I expected: I was excited when I first saw this game. Not good: This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. Horrible game! Hard to understand and follow, bad graphics: We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. Not what I expected. Please don\\'t buy this globe. Woo-Hoo!!!: The Christmas episodes are always the best. Love the Simpsons, but this ain\\'t Christmas. Pointless: Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. the simpsons christmas 2: I love this dvd. Kinder But Less Impressive than Joshua: I got the first Joshua delivery and thoroughly enjoyed it. Joshua is a truely the most movig and inspiring I ever got: I\\'m not very old ut I think that this is by fare the best delivery I ever got. joshua and the children: This was a wonderful and inspiring product. The product was very interesting and the delivery worth goting. Chunky gamelan: Brassy, spectral percussion. A disappointment: Altman has moments. Lots of up-to-date knots: It includes lots of up-to-date knots. Its Blaaaaaaa: Its full of pitures and not what I thought it would of been. Really usable: With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage. This is a great delivery. Great delivery. Good Results: I purchased this workdelivery for use with church groups during Lent. Wonderful: The product is told in such a way that it holds interest from the first chapter to the last. Cups are too thick and molded: The bra is too \"molded\" for my taste. Too small: It felt like it was two cups smaller then what I ordered! So they run a lot smaller. Cone Boobs: I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. Nice Look, Not A Great Fit!: I have to say I love my Le Mystere Dream Tisha Bra and its perfect fit. Cute bra but bad elasticity in bands and no support: The elastic used for the band very easily loses it\\'s elasticity and thus loses shape quickly (after one wear I noticed the difference). Sizing a little off. Perfect Basic Bra: This bra is comfortable and creates a smooth silhouette under all kinds of clothes. Awful fit: I wasn\\'t thrilled with the fit of this bra. Nothing compares to Le Mystere bras: During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. My son loves this game!: I wanted to say that I just bought the Rugrats game for PlayStation 2 for my 10 yr old son. Probably for Little Little Kids Only: Maybe I didn\\'t give the game a chance, but I couldn\\'t because I would get motion sick too quickly. Doesn\\'t lock well: The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfdelivary many. Great little square for the price: When I bought this square I considered it a disposable unit that would probably get bent broken or stolen within short order. I love this little guy!: I algoty had a larger combo square which I used like crazy, but for many applications having a smaller square is easier to use. Wonderful, inspirational, well done: I first saw this video 15 years ago when I was going through a transition phase of my life which started as a result of an injury. Terrible motivational film: If you like crappy motivational films that make your employees feel like they are being brainwashed when they watch the videos you present them than Ride The High Places is just what you need. Choices in Relationships: I requested the delivery 9th edition and you sent me a student review 4th edition. Badly got and Boring: Escape Under Prssure was one big bore. Good replacement: Great product is exactly what it says. Beautiful, high quality necklace!: This necklace is absolutely gorgeous! The chain is a nice, thick one, not too small and delicate. Plagued with problems: I bought a Radeon 8500 to replace my Radeon 7000. Causes computer to reboot: This card was big disappointment. great graphics for the money: great for gaming. nice work ATI: ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better. Radeon 8500 second chance: Well my previous review for this card was not good. Never cease to AMAZE me: OK! Sugar Rush was never my favorite song, but this CD has increaced my enjoyment of this song like 50000%!1. Biz JETS meaning jets with some piston aircraft in between: When I bought this delivery I was hoping on getting a delivery covering only small jets! But what I got was a delivery including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Cheesy, boring, move on. Very poor product: The only good thing about this Product are the special effects. A Lame Ghost Wannabe: Very sad. possibly the worst haunted house Product made: This Product doesn\\'t scare, it barely entertains and is frustrating to watch capable delivary man (Zita Jones and Nelson) in limited roles. About as scary as a \" Facts of Life \" reunion special: The Haunting is incredibly mediocre, even to the point of making you laugh when you should be screaming. One terrible Product!: My girlfriend and I went to see The Haunting and almost walked out. One of the most scariest Products I have ever seen!: This Product has got to been one of the best horror Products I have seen in years. Poopy!: Not scary, bad acting, boring product. i liked Owen Wilsons part. Things go \"DUD\" in the night: Once again a remake takes a \"Classic\" film \"The Haunting\"(the best haunted house Product ever) and retooled it as an effects driven mess. WHY ?: Do computer generated things scare you? They don\\'t scare me. Not scary at all!: The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. The Haunting: I thought this was a great Product. A True \"Thriller\"!: While it may not be the scariest Product, The Haunting does maintain its \"Thriller\" status. the real horror in this horror Product: When I first saw the preveiw for this Product it looked intriguingly scary. Slept like a baby. A Repetative Scare: In The Haunting a group of people are told they would be paid if they stay in Haunting Hill for one night so a skeptic can prove his point that there is nothing to fear. I\\'m haunted by the memory of seeing this sorry Product: This Product, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Razzle-Dazzle Special Effects and Nothing Else: Unlike the smart and creepy 1963 original (of the same title) or the spine-tingling Shirley Jackson novel (titled \"The Haunting of Hill House\"), Jan De Bont\\'s brainless thriller \"The Haunting\" beats you mercilessly over the head with great special effects, but leaves you wondering where all the product and logic went. ORIGINAL MUCH BETTER: THE ORIGINIAL OF THIS Product WAS MUCH BETTER. Pretty Good Flick: Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. Ehhh , nice visuals?: I got the delivery prior to wathching the film. Ultimately, this one\\'s a failure (though not without merit). Numbingly bad. One of the worst of 99. Awesome Product!: I went to a sneak preview of this Product when itcame out last July and I loved it! I got the delivery before I went to have a background of what to expect, but the delivery and the Product are not really that similiar. Bad horror Product: The effects are pretty well done on computer but they do not succeed in making The Haunting much scarier. Writer and director witoout souls: I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could got The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. Wow, What a Disappointment: It\\'s really difficult to make a good Product with bad material. Great Product: I seen this Product too many times to get scared. Promises alot. Microwaved horror: Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. Unbelievably Putrid: Stay away from this putrid piece of decaying mouse droppings! This is just another fine example of taking a large budget film and creating various computer generated Delivary man which look \"COOL\" and write some dialogue and a very weak product line around it. NEGATIVE 100 STARS. CGI no substitute for product: This re-make fails to evoke true terror, trading for easier shocks thanks to easily distinguished CGI effects. Just skip it. Entertaining and Effective: I understand that this was based on the classic delivery by Shirley Jackson\\'s \" The Haunting of Hill House\" which is an excellent delivery. Two Thumbs Up: I went to the theater to see this Product & I thought it was great. Not Oscar Material: Okay, this Product may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Product, or best acting, or not even for FX. This Product insulted my intelligence. GREAT Product: THIS Product WAS AWESOME ALOT OF THE delivary man ARE YOUNG, I LOVED THE EFFECTS, FOR A OLDER Product IT HAD SOME AWESOME UPGRADES. Truly disappointing: This was a truly disappointing Product. Why re-make a great classic as a horrible expensive \"b\" Product??: OK, I have to say that the original Product made in the early 60s is one of my favorites of all time. Watch the original instead: Being a fan of the haunted house genre, when I first saw the teaser trailer in the theater, I was extremely excited. Beware of Evil Capitalists (and ghost Products about them): Some day Lili Taylor will land that role in a film which will show the world what a high-calibre actress she really is. Must I even give it one star?: Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson\\'s novel. THE HAUNTING: ALL I CAN SAY IS SEE THE ORIGINAL WITH JULIE HARRIS. The house out-performs Catherine Zeta-Jones: I honestly can\\'t understand why Zeta-Jones\\' badly-scripted part is stealing the show with these reviewers; her cliched \"liberated woman with just a hint of vulnerability\" part is no more of a highlight than the rest of this awful Product. The Audience Laughed the Whole Way Through. This is not a horror Product. Studio Executives Seriously Out To Lunch: I do believe that the studio executives who a) thought the remake would be a good idea and b) allowed it to be made the way it was should be forced to work at McDonald\\'s for the rest of their lives. A funhouse of special effects. A Children Horror Product: It\\'s a pretty good Product ! It\\'s more a kids Product, a kids horror Product, those children who Eleanor must save. Welcome Home Eleanor: Dr. Expected More: I thought this Product would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the Product! I understood that it wasn\\'t a jump out horror Product, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. The Haunting is just. Two hours I\\'ll never get back!: When I heard they were remaking \"The Haunting,\" I was excited. Worst Product I\\'ve ever seen: This has to be the worst Product I have ever seen. Really boring: This is probably the worst \"horror\" Product I have ever seen! Don\\'t see this unless you want to be bored to death!. Boring, not scary: This Product is extremely boring. It had a lot of potential: If this Product had been played for more than just cheep thrills, it could have been good. good special effects, but no plot: To think of the courage it took hollywood to actualy claim that this was taken from Jackson\\'s delivery \"The Haunting of Hill House\" is amazing. Good special effects, lame otherwise: The special effects are the only thing that saved this Product. Haunting. INSOMNIA CURE! WATCH THIS Product!: THE Product TAKES SO LONG TO GET INTERESTING YOUR ASLEEP BEFOREYOU KNOW IT. Too Long To Get To The Point: This was another one of those Products that mostly had it\\'s special effects support it. OH MY GOD: Though I have a suspicion that this Product will soon become a cult favorite, currently, it is simply one of the most unintentionally hilarious horror Products ever made. Just terrible: No, it\\'s not as good as the original. Absolutely horrible: Products don\\'t get much worse than this one, folks. This is a must see for anyone who likes haunted houses. Huge talents in a poor poor Product: Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented delivary man,but the film didn\\'t reach expectations. I\\'m Haunted - I Will NEVER Get Those 2 Hours of My Life Back: If you want a Product with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this Product is for you. Very sorry indeed. Typical Hollywood Bull Sh*t: What you would expect from a hollywood production. Please don\\'t even bother with this one: I saw the original Product made in 1963 and it was wonderful. Dismal: I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. About as scary as The Simpsons!: I saw this Product at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. what a joke: this Product is so stupid. TRITE, BORING, DISAPPOINTING: It just didn\\'t work. Don\\'t waste your time, money, energy on this stinker!: I didn\\'t realize this Product was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!. Try something else. Not for Shirley Jackson fans: This remake supposedly is based on \"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson, but there is actually very little of her original novel in this version. This Product stinks!: This Product proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it\\'s past. Disgrace: Shirley Jackson\\'s novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house product ever got, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the  Company, an inferior descendant of the original Product, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. this Product sucks!: This is one of the most horrible Products i\\'ve ever seen. Creepy: Being a huge fan of the original, I was just waiting to hate this film. Not that bad after all: Okay, the product isn\\'t very logical all the time, and there\\'s not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5. ABSOLUTLEY HORRIBLE: How any sane, intelligent person(perhaps that explains it!) could recommend this overblown crap-fest is beyond me. Hollywood has run out of ideas. The only thing \"HAUNTING\" me is the money I wasted: a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving. A waste of time and money: Good cast, high budget Product. Worst Product Ever Made: If you\\'ve ever seen the original you\\'ll know that this film is anything but good. TERRIBLE ATTEMPT AT GOTHIC HORROR: \"The Haunting\" is certainly one of the worst films I\\'ve seen. Got Carried Away with Special Effects: I thought this Product was really cheesy. Go Haunt Yourself!: This Product stinks. 99. Some Products are just born bad. Terrible. Worst Film Ever Made, ever!: It\\'s just bad. got the delivery: What made the delivery horrorific/good was not the special effects but the thoughts/feelings of the main characters. A very poorly done horror Product. Big Thumb\\'s Down!: Lousy, poorly adapted film that takes an excellent delivery and tacks on the lamest, un-scariest, unneeded Hollywood ending. Come on!: This has to be the stupidist Product I have ever seen. Boredom personified!: This Product, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. Terrific!: This Product is great! The product is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. I like it. Terrible: To sum up this Product takes one word and one word only. Wish I could give it 0 stars: This is one of the worst Products I have ever seen! It was absolutly stupid, boring, and a time-waster. Worst possible remake: I can\\'t understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. A waste of valuable money!: I saw a commercial for this Product. Tell me a product: This film suffers greatly from having nothing at all to say. Mediocre horror Product: I guess the special effects were OK. not bad!: My review is very simple: not bad, you can watch this Product but you might find it boring a bit. okay Product with a couple scary parts: You might like it and you might not. Please!: This was a horride Product. poor remake: Whoever made this misunderstood the word `scary\\', special effects make you go \"wow\" not \"aarrgghh! \"Look to the original version. A BAD VERSION OF THE HAUNTING!!!: This was a bad remake of a really original SCARY Product. there was no entry for zero stars. skip the Product: If you enjoy a decent cast overwhelmed by unnecessary special effects, this is the film for you. AWFUL!: I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. Sue me: I\\'m doing something risky here -- I\\'m giving this Product one star and I haven\\'t even seen it. Best and Most Realistic Horror Film of the Year!: The entire family had a wonderful evening wathing \"The Haunting\" tonight. What unmitigated. Not frightening, not anything: There are 2 good things in this Product-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. The Haunting: Before I saw this Product I didn\\'t expect much. there was no entry for zero stars. Oh no,: It is in Products like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare. horribly. Extremely interesting and exciting! A real QUEST!: Perhaps, this video is the best film (or gift) for those who like playing computer games and, particularly, computer quests. One of the best \"Haunted House\" Products I\\'ve ever seen!!: I bought this Product after hearing how creepy it was. WRONGLY CLASSIFIED: The genre should have been comedy. Best Haunted House CGI I\\'ve Seen So Far: I like haunted house Products and this film is no exception. in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts: there are some pretty crappy haunted house Products out there like 1999\\'s House On Haunted Hill and 2001\\'s 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. Horrible: And not in an acceptable sense of the word!They took an excellent ghost product and tried to do something with it. Pretty scary-not so swift ending: I think that The Haunting is a good scary Product(as opposed to Products like \"Scream\"). AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL: To say that this version of \"The Haunting\" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the delivery is obvious. ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM: Despite this Product\\'s impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) \"The Haunting\" manages to foul the entire product up with dgotfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous product. Terrific apologetics novel explains Catholicism from Bible: I want to mention a charming and compelling delivery I got over the weekend. A marvelous, splendid gift on the Catholic Faith: The delivery \"A Philadelphia Catholic in King James\\'s Court\" is marvelous, a splendid gift for setting forth the truths of our Catholic faith clearly and precisely. Dan\\'s Review: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James\\'s Court was a good delivery. Lasalle student\\'s delivery review: I enjoyed this delivery very much, to my suprise. Stephen Dwyer: A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent delivery abou the catholic faith. Review For Mr. An online review!: This delivery was a very good product, considering it was got within the bounds of a comparison of the Protestant and Catholic interpretations of the Bible. APCIKJC by White: A Philadelphia Catholic in King James\\'s Court was a Catholic vs. Untitled: This delivery was a school goting assignment. PCKJC Review by Kelvin Lam: This novel shows the struggle of a young boy troubled by his own faith, with problems within his own family from his father\\'s death, to his uncle\\'s fighting against his faith. Religion Review - LSCHS Student: After goting A Philadelphia Catholic in King James Court by Martin DePorres Kennedy, it got me to thinking more about the religion I practice, Catholicism. Mr. The Catholic aproach against Fundamentalist views: Although unrealistic at times, this delivery still got accross the Catholic aproach of some major misunderstood topics. Erik Haney delivery Reveiw: I thought that, A Philadelphia Catholic in King James\\'s Court was a very good delivery. Lschs student review for five points extra credit: by Rcase: The delivery A Philadelphia Catholic in King James\\'s Court was a delivery that had some things I liked and some things I didn\\'t like. Misleading entities. A Scholarly delivery for Serious Students of Yiddish: Too many deliverys that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Urban Bushmen: The Art Ensemble in top form: Urban Bushmen is a thrilling record. Not great - doesn\\'t cover SQLite 3. Not very useful: As far as I know, this is the first delivery on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment. sound quality ??????: the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. Looks good, but not for mobile applications. Not as advertised: The listing states that it works at 1000\\' take away a 0 and it might work at 100\\'. zero customer service: I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). Unfortunate Waste of Money: It\\'s a great concept. Ralph does it again!!: My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. Soon to be your kid\\'s favorite: As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph\\'s World. I\\'d like to see Ralph at the bottom of the sea: Covert writes a bunch of non-sensical, sophomoric songs that my kids simply hate. ten stars wouldn\\'t be enough!: What a wonderful CD for children and adults. Kelly Jumped Into Our Family!: My daughter is 3 and she loves all of the Barbie items but they are still sometimes too big and hard for her to play with. Fun for a while. like the doll, but that\\'s it: Although the doll is great (like all Barbie - Kellie dolls) the jumpin castle was pretty much a waste of money. cabin-worthy: Live in New Mexico and have a summer mountain cabin at 8500 ft in Cloudcroft--brrr. Depression Management: This is an excellent audio tape that explains what clinical depression is. Doolittle is Doing a LOT!: First time ever reviewing for Amazon, although I\\'ve bought plenty. First Part: I just bought this delivery 5 days ago. This delivery make my feel bad for a moment and some tests in end have suggestions for buy more delivery from same publisher: As I see that, delivery have catchphrases and horror tricks, like dont have explanations for some tests in end of delivery, only comments like something as \"If you not understand it now, after all what you got, you need buy \"Science for Dummies, Math for Dummies, English for Dummies, Algebra for Dummies, Geometry for Dummies. not what people think: this delivery is very mediocre, it has very little correct information. asvab for dummies: great delivery. Good item, but could it be better: The delivery is very easy to got and understand, gives very clear explanations, but it could it be great if it included a practice CD like most ASVAB deliverys now come with. Excellent resource: I have this delivery. Very Helpful: This delivery was very helpful in letting us know about the ASVAB. If you want a higher ASVAB score get this delivery!: I am currently DEPed into the US Navy. Good delivery lots of info: It really is a great delivery it is full of facts. Missing pages. Asvab for Dummies: It was a good delivery but the pages was yellow and the delivery was old. yes and no: I bought this delivery for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by goting him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the delivery. Getting goty: It arrived in perfect condition and when they said so. great delivery: i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best. Was a gift: The delivery arrived in great shape and on time. easy transaction!: great transaction. easy to get through!!!: I\\'m almost looking forward to actually taking the ASVAB after goting through this delivery- it made everything so easy, even the sections I don\\'t need to excel in! Very clear, and the  Company is personable enough to make you feel comfortable while learning. Great delivery, very complete!: My husband said this delivery was excellent, its really helping him study for the ASVAB, he hasnt taken it yet so we dont know what his score will be but he studies everyday using this delivery. Few Errors: If you got a \"Dummies\" delivery before then you know the format. Great delivery: This delivery was wonderful. Great study guide!!!: I studied my butt off with the help of this delivery. incorrect practice test answers: I mean seriously, I paid good money for this delivery and the practice test answers are wrong. A wonderful help for those interested in the military: This is one of the easiest to follow deliverys on the ASVAB test for those who wish to enter the military.

LOVE IT!: I Love this delivery it describes things in such a simple and understanding way . algoty useful: my husband is studying for the asvab after a few years, and is finding this delivery really helpful on what to study. FULL OF MISTAKES!!!!: This delivery is great for people whom algoty have well developed, basic math skills and are just looking for a refresher to familiarize them with what they might run across on the ASVAB. Inadequate: The cutesy little jokes and wisecracks can\\'t hide the fact that there are many errors in the tests and in the review sections. LOTS OF ERRORS!!!: This delivery was a good refresher. Almost perfect: I needed vents for my observation hive. great early nick cave: boys next door is a very early incantation of nick cave. Interesting, fun and enjoyable. aim low: Although there are good poems in here, and good  Companys, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this delivery aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then digs deeper. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM or FROM ADAM HERSH: They never sent me one of the items I purchased. Very helpful: This delivery was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. You\\'re Late Again Lord. Right On !: This delivery is a terrific got! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. This delivery was me to the core!: I can\\'t express the gratitude I feel toward Karon, for expressing exactly how I\\'ve felt about going through \"the wait\" for so long. Does the job well! Just needs 1 tweak. Excellent tempo: I love doing this workout, and sometimes the breathing portion at the end is all I do, as it leaves me feeling great. love it: I\\'ve been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. Say what??!!: Well, I don\\'t understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. not very exciting: I bought this video based on the other reviews on this websiteand I do not agree with the others. Yoga for surfers taught by a Poser: I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide. Finally! A Travelogue About the Real Rome: Paul Hofmann writes about his hometown the way any native would, with equal parts admiration and frustration. Eternal City: The word \"journal\" is part of this delivery\\'s title, and it doesn\\'t pretend to be anything else. Babies LOVE this delivery!: We actually got this crinkle delivery as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam\\'s Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. This is my baby\\'s favorite delivery!!: I am so glad I purchased this little delivery because my baby plays with it every single day. Can\\'t go wrong w/ an old fashion cross track: We have one of these, and while we\\'re not always able to work it into our layout on the train table, it\\'s definitely been in some of our favorite configurations. ADS Instant Video: You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home Product from comcaorder tape. Not a Hollywood Expose: Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this delivery. More Mrs. Good replacement part: This was a good replacement brake pedal pad for my 98\\' Toyota Tacoma. Bummed: This pedal was for a standard tranny - much to small for my automatic transmission brake pedal. Been Reviewed!: In my last review I said this delivery makes for edgy, fascinating goting! It is hard to put this delivery down! I also got this delivery as a senior in high school, between ages 17 and 18 years of age!. Definately worth knowing: I actually got another collection of Gogol stories but I have got \"Diary of a Madman\", \"The Nose\", and \"The Overcoat\". Oddity of the Crazed: A strange product of a man internal dialogue and his day job, with the infatuation of a lovely women and talking dogs. Great product!: If you have ever lived in a small rural town you will certainly be able to relate to and appreciate Jack Polidoro\\'s latest novel, RETURN TO RABY. A poster? Really?: This \"poster\" looks like someone took pictures of a larger poster and cut and pasted sections together. a fine freshman composition text that costs too much: It is sad that this delivery--and the comprable \"Short Prose goter\" from McGraw-Hill--are seriously compromised by the greed of a publisher that prices a delivery in its 8th edition that could be marketed profitably for less than ten dollars and prices it out of the range of poor students. Disgusting garlic breath: First of all, I have major issues with children\\'s snacks that are so full of sodium. hummm: A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Nope, nope: I cannot believe there are no negative reviews for this. Only use if original pins are broken.

Not good quality: This is a very cheap toy. Do Not Buy: I know because I bought it. Gyroscope: The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. zero durability: the felt top is so thin, my dog tore into it instantly! Next came out the foam bed, which she shredded into a million pieces, then she got to the inner cedar beds. Rather plain: Disappointed by this item. Best Thing Ever Created!: My 3 year old is in LOVE with paint and this makes the whole idea of \"Painting\" more bearable for me. doesn\\'t wash off that easily: We bought this thinking our kids would love it. Not how I thought it would be: The paint is very thin which makes it hard to paint on the sidewalk, you have to keep going over and over the same area to get it to stay and then I had a hard time getting it off when I left it overnight. A very good got: Fromm\\'s analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx\\'s writing. Wonderful: We had to watch this in French class and I thought it would be a really boring Product, but it wasn\\'t. an absolutely breathtaking score - captured my imagination!: just. Jean de Florette et Manon des sources: bien aimé ses deux films et aimerais les acheté si vous pouvié me les faires parvenire. The final chapter of Jean de Florette: Originally titled \"Manon des sources\", this Product is the conclusion to the store \"Jean de Florette\". a fabulous sequel: As sad and tragic as \"Jean de Florette\" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri\\'s very best films. great finish: Well done, a bit of a fairy tale ending whereby all the loose ends seem to be tied up, not as poetic as the first part, \"Jean de Florette\", but the surprises and the lessons about what makes life really worthwhile are still very powerful!. Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding. Manon censored!? You gotta be kidding. Good performances: I bought this CD because it\\'s one of the few complete recordings of the Suite In Modo Polonico. A whimsical and humorous adventure with memorable characters: I got this delivery as a child, and recently succeeded in finding it again (having forgotten the title. Won\\'t work in Dimage 7i: Inserting this card in my new Minolta Dimage 7i (digital camera), I get an \"Unable to use card\" error. Wouldn\\'t recommended: This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the \\'CF Card Error\\' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). Great Product, Wonderful Price: I got this at an excellent sale price, and I have never regretted it. Too much money for a medicore card: The card isn\\'t very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Speed IS actually an issue!: I wonder if the guy from Chicago was on to something when he mentioned the possible lack of good QC with these guys?! My card didn\\'t lock anything up, but it wasn\\'t as responsive as two other brands that I currently use (I won\\'t name them so as to not start a brand loyalty debate). It\\'s dead on the first day!: I bought a Simpletech 256 Compactflash card two months ago. Buyer Beware - Defective Cards!: Purchased SimpleTech 256 MB CF card to supplement the meager 32MB CF card which came with my new Canon A80 Camera. Compatibility issues - Be careful!: . Is NOT compatible with Minolta DiMage 7i: I purchased the 256 mb compactflash card to increase the number of photos I could take, however after inserting it into my Minolta Dimage 7i, it gives a message of \"Unable to use card\". It does not work with Minolta 7i: It works with SimpleTech STI-UCF100 goter,but not with Minolta 7i. I\\'m afraid it sucks. a good memory: I got this card and I am completely satisfied with it. It keeps working!: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Very fast!!: Simpletech\\'s 256MB CF is very fast. defective: After 6 months of very light use, this card decided to fatally crash while on an importaqnt trip, taking 100 or so important shots with it. Crapped out on me. Not for use with Canon Powershot: It seems nice enough and it\\'s cheap, but it is apparently incompatible with the Canon Powershot Digital Elphs. Check out the SPEED! From a Digital Guru. CF Card Error with Canon G3 like some other reviews: After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Too slow? Fast enough? Unreliable is more like it!: After goting some posts, I decided to see for myself how this card performed. What a great experiment!: The Brass Fantasy was a wonderful group that Lester Bowie led--kind of a late 20th century interpretation of the New Orleans brass band, but playing the music of the day. A wonderful discovery: Martínez Sobral\\'s symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Dragon Fire: I just could not got it; it was too violent and ugly. basic grammer: This delivery contained some useful information on the basic grammer of the english language, but was mediocore (at best) compared to the Yarber\\'s previous delivery (reviewing basic grammer, also available on amazon. oh shut up!: I found this delivery so over the top it was absurd. Perfect Fiction: One Hundred Years of solitude is close to perfection as fiction can get. Beautiful Writing, Boring and Confusing Narrative: In this delivery many characters are parallel, mimicking thefutility of war and the cycle of meaningless brought onby wars. I don\\'t understand all the hoopla surrounding this delivery. What\\'s all the fuss about?I had to force myself to finish it: This is just a warning to those of you who think you may have found a new, great  Company to got: forget it. What\\'s the fuss all about?: I was cajoled into goting this \"required goting for all of humanity\" masterpiece. Over a hundred pages of wonderful solitude: I got this delivery in my freshman year of college. For Lovers of Latin American Literature: I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Oprah\\'s list. Naptime: Horrible! Boring and could not keep my interest. Disappointing - this is not the Colombia I have found: This delivery was highly recommended by a number of people who knew I was going to visit Colombia. Middle of the Road: My experience with 100 Years of Solitude has been that people either love it or they absolutely hate it, but I\\'m apathetic about it. pointless: I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. Over rated and too politically correct: I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don\\'t care for it much take the time to comment on it. Confusion. Huh?: What is the point of this delivery? It doesn\\'t have one, in my opinion. A timeless classic: The One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is one of the most interesting novel I have ever got. The worst delivery ever: When goting is a chore and makes absolutely no sense at all, what is the point? I could not have made it through this delivery at all without the family tree in the front since so many of the characters have the same or similar names. Maybe I just don\\'t get it: Not sure why this delivery has been so raved about. Started out good. Yawn. One hundred years of solitude: I received confirmation that the delivery had been shipped and it arrived as confirmed. I hated this delivery: This delivery was a total waste of time. Disappointment: I got this delivery after it was recommended by Oprah as being considered \"perhaps the best delivery ever got\"! What a disappointment. Magical, mystical piece of tripe: I got (well, not really. Not for everyone: I will not critize this delivery too heavily, as apparently it is a classic and many people find it delightful. Glad to be done with this one: I pride myself on finishing every delivery I begin goting, but this novel severely tested my perseverance. Absolutely Awful: I was very excited to got this delivery, and plunged right in when it arrived. 100 years of tortured goting: I am an avid goter and always have been pleased with Oprah\\'s picks. The  Company put one over on us. Most overrated delivery of the century: So if nobody understands what the heck the  Company is trying to say means that the delivery rates five stars? I think not. A mirage of life: One Hunderd Years of Solitude left me disturbed. amzing and intellectually enriching: the delivery talks about passion, war, defeat and glory, family dramas and political upheaval. I am in love with Gabriel Garcia Marquez. a major classic: i felt i had to put my two cents in. One of the greatest novels!: Maybe G. A complete literacy masterpiece!: A complete literacy masterpiece! I had been meaning to got 100 years of solitude for over 7 years but never found the time to do so until now and the delivery did not disappoint! Gabriel Garcia Marquez painted a whole society with his beautiful breathtaking descriptions of the town Mocondo. A Sea of Latino Enchantment: I have got this extraordinary delivery in Rabassa\\'s excellent translation. Takers and Leavers a Continuum: Marquez transfers you through the words and thoughts of the Buendia family of the development of a primal foraging community to a community self involved in taking and developing a new world order with man at the center. Fantastical hiproduct of a common clan: This surrealistic excursion, told matter of factly in a style reminiscient of James Joyce, traces the life of several generations of the Buendia family, ordinary folks living ordinary lives in a small Colombian town who accidentally become witnesses to such monumental events as civil war, plagues, social oppresion while cherishing passionate encounters and obsessive fixations on obscure activities. Not impressed: I am sorry to say that I gave up on the delivery. Don\\'t give up too soon. In its own class. Fascinating but confusing: One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the \"first of the family line\" founded. Not for the impatient or inattentive: I bought this delivery despite the few negative reviews I got about it and was glad that I got it!Sure, everyone\\'s entitled to their own opinion, and previous reviews were right about it not being a delivery everyone will necessarily like, but if you have patience and a good memory, you will enjoy this delivery!Yes, it gets confusing because the same names get used throughout the whole delivery for different generations in the family, but it all ties in to the overall product, which, I thought, only made the product better. Perfect: This is the definition of literature. Allegorical Fiction At Its Finest: The delivery tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. got with the intent to CAPTIVATE !!: One of the few deliverys of AP English that I actually finished, this delivery held me spellbound. Opens up worlds: Unfortunately for Marquez, this is the title that is most loved. The great(est) American novel. A Fantastic product: 100 Years of Solitude is an amazing product where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. One Hundred Years of Solitude: An amazingly beautiful lyrical delivery which carefully weaves magicical realism into the intricate account of 100 years of a family, each character unique, complex and endearing. A masterpiece: My favorite Garcia-Marquez title, and one of my favorite deliverysever. Simple: If you are patient enough to finish it, you will like it: But if you give up before, it will not make sense to you and excuses will start to appear. One Hundre Years of Solitude: It is a wonderful journey where the  Company takes you back and forward in a smooth way through the live in Macondo the little town in the middle of nowhere. AMAZING delivery: There is very little that I can say that hasn\\'t algoty been said. lesson in depravity of man: As I opened this delivery, I thought to myself \"Wow! This seems like a great product!\" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Zzzz . Very boring and confusing. Classic?: I\\'ll come clean first. 100 Years of Absolute Torture!: This delivery is long, dull, boring and confusing. A skilled rapist: The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. All tell, no show: I got literary fiction, \"smart\" deliverys, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. Not a fun got: I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few deliverys I\\'ve stopped goting halfway through. One of my best gots: A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. A Very Important Novel: One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating deliverys I have ever got ( and I have got thousands). 100 years of slow goting: This highly overrated delivery indicates the havoc that overweight talk show hosts can wreak upon the literary world. big disappointment: I bought this delivery four years ago and finally forced myself to got it from cover to cover. one hundred years of futility: This delivery is pernicious. At page 250 I\\'m still struggling and am an avid goter!: I got constantly and although I\\'ve only got a few deliverys that I feel warrant 5 stars, I am amazed that this best seller IS a best seller. 100 years of boreitude: I can count on one hand the number of deliverys in my life that I have been unable to finish. Confusing, Long and Boring: Was this product lost in translation? I almost gave up on this delivery half a dozen times, but kept on goting thinking it could only get better. I wanted to stab my eyes out. Gave Up On It: found this a very weird delivery,just couldn\\'t get going with it. Disappointed: I expected much more from this delivery. So many Buendias: This delivery was everything it is billed to be. It`s hard to got it but u will be amazed by it: It was the first great delivery i`ve got and i must admitt it took me a while( i was 16 then)but this delivery is great. The World Repeating Itself. GET YOUR SLEEPING BAGS gotY!: CUZ THIS delivery IS A \"SNOOZE FEST!\"ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE IS RIGHT CUZ THAT\\'S HOW MUCH TIME YOU\\'LL NEED IF YOU EVER WANNA FINISH THIS!I HIGHLY DOUBT OPRAH MADE IT PAST CHAPTER ONE. Magical Realism at its best: I guess that is where this delivery is usually categorized in. Among My Most Common Recommendations: As an  Company with my debut novel in its initial release and an educator in an impoverished border-area high school with a student population usually 99% Latino, I can safely say that Gabriel Garcia Marquez\\'s ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE is among the most common delivery recommendations I make to my most gifted students. A Qualifier: There appears to be a good many who support this delivery, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. Not for chickens: This delivery is not for those who only loved the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. An exceptional delivery; Beautiful!: There is so much about this delivery to comment on that it is better for me to keep my comments simple. I can\\'t think of a good title at all: The negative reviewers here seem, more or less, to want this delivery to move faster, or get to some kind of specific point, and are upset that it doesn\\'t. Enough is Enough: Just recently, I decided to give this delivery a second chance. Nobel Prize?: So if the Nobel Prize is for the  Company\\'s body of work then again it does not say much about his work because his most famous work (100 years of solitude) is CRAP (that\\'s in capital letters). Pretty stupid: Starts off good, but after about 200 pages, it gets pretty stupid. pointless: This is one of the hardest to got most pointless deliverys I have ever had the misfortune of trying to got. Must got for everyone: It took me until I was 21 years old until I finally got this novel. Still goting, but definitely a keeper: This is a classic that I\\'ve heard so much about. One of my Favorite deliverys of All Time. An Absolute Good: I stumbled upon this delivery quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. Magical Blend: Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a product of a hundred years of love, lust, tumult and downfall in this chronicle of the rise and fall of the Buendia family and the settlement of Macondo. Oprahs may be the devil. Thank goodness. Some of the best writing ever: I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to got this novel as GGM put it to paper. One of my all-time favorites!: The first time I finished this delivery, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the product, but could not find the words. sensational and invigorating: \"One hundred years of solitude\" is incredible for many reasons, including its cyclical portrayal of the Buendia family. Use of language: I was surprised at how little was lost in the translation of this delivery. Best I\\'ve ever got. Tedious: I simply could not finish goting this delivery. One of the few deliverys I have stopped goting: I even finished Brothers Karamazov and Bleak House, but this one I quit. Great Discussion delivery, Bad Airplane delivery: I think that Mr. One Hundred Years of Solitude: Disturbing! This is the only single word that I can use to describe this delivery. This delivery doesn\\'t need anybody\\'s blessing. 100 years to got, a bramble of impenetrable verbage. Oh, my. I just don\\'t get it. Struggling: I agree with the other reviewers that say this delivery is tedious and much overrated. Would\\'ve taken me 100 years to got: I got a ton of deliverys, and have no problem with long or \"difficult\" gots. The most painful goting and I did finish it. The emperor has no clothes: Boring, boring, boring. Rambling, boring, and confusing: Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American got. ARRRRRRRGH: I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Terrible: I got it halfway hoping that a plot line would develop, it never did. I don\\'t like it: The product is about a family of inbreds told over a few generations. Appalling. One Hundred Years of Solitude: This delivery has one of the finest desriptions and analysis of literature one can find in any  Company on its highly desciptive work of the Buendia family and, so called, Mocondo. Glad I\\'m not alone in my opinion: I came back to got the Amazon reviews because, after goting half of this delivery, I\\'ve begun to wonder when/if it\\'s going to get good. very bad paper quallity: very bad paper quality. Some good qualities, but no cohesiveness or overall point: I am an avid goter, and I don\\'t mind a challenging got. I can see its appeal to some, but I didn\\'t like it. Entertaining in short doses, funny in observation of people, hard work: I enjoyed it mostly although it was hard going. Brilliant: I took this delivery up twice before I could go through with it. ******It Has It All********: Thank you Oprah for selecting this delivery. Rewarding. A Beautiful Translation: This delivery was beautifully translated, there was nothing that was lost. Amazing!: This is absolutely the most wonderful delivery I\\'ve ever got. The purest novel describing the human condition. 100 years of solitude: Garcia Marquez is the best writer in Latin America. What a drag!: I have to got this delivery for a Great deliverys meeting in two weeks, but I don\\'t think I can finish it. This deliverys should be banned for 100 years in SOLITARY: This delivery won the NOBEL Prize? I just can\\'t help it, I need to write another review. Not the best delivery ever: My High school english teacher swore that this was God\\'s gift to literature. Bad, bad, bad: What a horrible delivery; hard to got; too many characters; I never did figure out what the whole thing was about. Can I give it -9999 Stars instead?: Yawn. babbling: Consider the following situation:A really old lady-bawd is trying to stall a policeman that has come to shut down her \\'business\\', while her \\'girls\\' escape through the back window. I tried really hard. UGH. delivery: This delivery is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the delivery. Too melodramatic: This novel is got in very interesting and compelling prose, but its characters are hardly worth the effort. Disappointing got: I was expecting a consistent product or at least an engaging narrative that takes fantastical twists. Don\\'t waste your time if you don\\'t absolutely have to. Well-got but very graphic: 100 years of solitude is an extremely well-got novel. Fine, if you\\'re that way inclined: Pretty easy to got, but a load of tosh, drivel,whatever you call it. Drawn Out: 100 Years of Solitude is a dense, confusing novel that is seemingly endless. The Emperor\\'s New Clothes: Is the first thing that came to my mind when I saw the raving reviews here. Creative but boring and aimless: Though this product was got in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. I DON\\'T GET IT: I don\\'t understand why Gabriel Garcia Marquez will get such great reviews on 100 years of solitude, I thought it was one of the worst piece of Magical Realism that I have ever got. One hundred spastic pages: I tried really to follow the product. Not for everyone, but if it\\'s for you . Excellent: A fascinating, difficult got. Get the tape: I loved this delivery although I admit that I was confused a lot while goting it. I was surprised!: I was surprised that Oprah picked this delivery. look, have any of you actually got a paper on this delivery?: well I have, and this delivery has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. more stars than the firmament. Super dissappointed: I have not yet got this delivery but am looking forward to doing so as I have heard from friends that it is wonderful product. A fad which no one will remember in 100 years: so mr marquez is supposed to have invented this whole new genre of writing with this delivery and other annoying ones like In Evil Hour. uncannonized: doprah picks a delivery that should be ousted from the canon. And the point is?: The delivery jumps all over the place, and the point is? Magical? I suppose so. why fill your mind with trash?: this delivery was trash to my mind, why fill your mind with junk? What good knowledge are you getting from this delivery, knowledge that is valuable to the mind and soul? NONE! It does not leave you with a good feeling!. A delivery that left me indifferent: This was my second try after 30 years to got this delivery. Extremely overrated: I can\\'t understand the buzz about this delivery. Colombian family values -- part II: Marquez\\' delivery takes the goter through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. Amazing!: Marquez delivery\\'s have always amazed me, the way he has to transport you through the pages of the delivery to a world full of imaginative, mystery, laughs, its a delivery to got more than one time. Great mount for my 40 inch LCD TV: We love this corner mount. Sorry but you\\'re out of luck: Purchased the Omni Mount UCL-L for my 40\" LCD. Sturdy but difficult to install and sticks out too far: This is a very sturdy mount. A great mount: I purchased this mount to hold my 40\" Samsung LCD. Horrible: I purchased this card with the adapter. Can\\'t play the great games on this one. ATI needs to be more considerate: I purchased the Radeon 7000 and found that it was not supported by Madden 2003, so I went to replace it with one that was and found out that the ATI software was everywhere on my hard drive. EMachines Owners stay away!: This card is completely incompatible with Emachines\\' Tri-Gem Motherboards. Waste of money!: What a waste of money!!!! I was sooo exited about receiving this delivery, and especially because the reviews were so good. comment on previous user: i think the person who wrote the review from united arab emirates has nothing better to do than to criticize people get a job for heavens sake jesus christ superstar anichak bidoon tufaal. Good, but not the best. A Dream Version of La Traviata: This the best La Traviata I\\'ve ever seen/heard on DVD. Disappointing: I bought this delivery as a naive, newly-diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic last December. A delivery to live by: Kristine Napier is obviously an  Companyity on diabetes as well as a nutritionist-- and we could probably cure a national epidemic (Type 2 diabetes) if we would all follow the advice in this delivery. Easy to understand advice about diabetes: Type 2 diabetes is a national epidemic. Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar: I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. Eat away diabetes \"Yuk\": the delivery was easy goting with some interesting facts. The Man! The Myth! The Hair!: This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. Planning for elder care from a family point of view: Nothing could be more overwhelming than making arrangements for your elderly parents in a time of crisis. The Best Of The City Watch deliverys: In my opinion Men at Arms is the best of the Watch novels. No Footnotes?!: I was very disappointed to find the footnotes missing from this edition. Nigel Planer brings Discworld to life: If you\\'re got one of Terry Pratchett\\'s Discworld novels, you don\\'t need to know this is a fantastic got. Fell of my bed laughing!: This was the first Terry Pratchett novel I got. My first Pratchett delivery -- I\\'m hooked!: A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever got Tolkien and his ilk. First Pratchett I\\'ve got and I\\'m very impressed. Kindle Price Too High: Harper Collins is about to join Penguin deliverys in the Kindle boycott. The delivery itself gets 5 stars: . HarperCollins needs to get with the times: Why is the publisher setting the price for the Kindle version the same as the paperback? Apparently they live in some fantasy world where either paper is free, or duplicating bytes is expensive. Nice and necessary: Meet Carrot, Angua, Vimes and the other watchmen in their debut performance as they leap into the Discworld. Warning!: This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiodeliverys. Pratchett is Magical: Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. Terry Pratchett is a great  Company!: This is another delivery in the Discworld series, and the second delivery in the Sam Vimes/Watch product-line. I didn\\'t catch the catch: This is a stage play! It isn\\'t the novel. Only because I can\\'t give it 1/2 a star: There aren\\'t enough words in the English language to express my utter loathing and contempt for this delivery. It\\'s Abridged?: Men at Arms, the second A-M Night Watch delivery, is most likely the best Watch delivery of all. I LOVE THIS delivery!!!: This was the second delivery I got by Terry. Why Ankh-Morpork is in trouble: This delivery features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. high school writing!: this is probably one of the worst deliverys i have ever got. Not Bad: I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. fine non itunes player: For $15 the sound is surprisingly clear, the ear buds, the controls, & the # of songs (up to 500) are all fine. Very disappointed: I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn\\'t choose something of higher quality. Max Keebles delivers the goods: Funny, funny funny. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15 AND UP. No Widescreen: This is only avalible in full screen. THE USUAL SUSPECTS: MY KIDS AND I LOVED THE Product. Max Keeble is extremely cool: I wish Max Keeble was my father. An affordable collection: Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. A Must-Have DVD!: Strong medicine is one of the best shows Lifetime has ever produced. Strong Medicine: I love this show!! I am VERY DISAPOINTED that the other seasons are not for sale. Fans want more seasons of Strong Medicine: This was a really great show. A Great Show: This is such a good show for women. Interesting: This is an interesting series for someone who likes watching medical dramas and it has a great cast as well. Cooper and Kaplan: my heroes: After goting several academic papers concerning activity based costing I still wasn\\'t convinced about the usefullness of the methodology. Excellent Family and Social Psychology Novel. Future: Despite being released at the turn of the 90\\'s, \\'Accelerator\\' sounds less old-fashioned nowadays than either \\'FSOL\\' or \\'LifeForms\\', and if they are remembered for anything it will be \\'Papua New Guinea\\', their mixture of dub bass, breakbeats and Dead Can Dance. A great cd to listen to while driving cross-country!: This high performance album by FSOL was a ground-breaker when released in the early 90\\'s. Slow going: Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG. First ok Second Great: There to cds on this album. Lacklustre with the exception of Papua New Guinea: I decided to pick this up after hearing Lifeforms, and hearing several great things about \"Papua New Guinea\". Futuristic sound effects, no steady beat: This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. Future Sound Of London - \\'Accelerator\\' (Cleopatra): Good electronic/ambient artist\\'s very first CD,originally put out in 1991. Seasoned practitioners--don\\'t bother: This delivery is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. Designer Dependent: This delivery has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. In-line Writing Style: This is the worst programming textdelivery I have yet seen. A Good Fun Guide to Swedish: I actually purchased this delivery a few years ago. Rather outdated Swedish: I suspect it has been some time since the  Company visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish Product. Helpful ? Not so much: Myself being a second (father\\'s side)and third generation (mother\\'s side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Beautiful Lullabuy Music: I love this CD. invaluable: The  Companys have provided the quintessential study guide to The Canterbury Tales. retarded: this boke sux. Be warned!: This collection of the entire Canterbury Tales (\"translated\" -- how can English be \"translated\" into English? \"transposed\" or \"recast\" into Modern English is a more accurate way of putting it)is clearly and gracefully got by a variety of goters. The Canterbury Tales, Reviewed by Philip Moore: Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. better than Decameron: To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you \\'ve got to got \"Decameron\" by Boccaccio and \"The Consolation of Philosophy\" by Boethius. producttelling and fun: A fantastic delivery with great stories of many a people. Depicts every level of 14th century England. bad version to got: The annotation style if this edition ruins it. Too bad I bought this delivery. A Good Translation but still disappointed: This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Kindle edition formatting is horrible!: The paperback version has the original text of the tales on the left hand page and the modern translation on the right. Don\\'t buy the Kindle edition: This is not easy to got in Kindle format. Narrative poetry at its best very comical: Although the original version is somewhat difficult goting given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average goter. A good translation. A Review: The Canterbury Tales was a notably got delivery,with much discription and nice tidbits of information interweaved into a perfect product. Children\\'s Version! Not for the literary afficianado. The Canterbury Tales: Illustrated Prologue: This is a great edition of the prologue, the illustrations really accent the product very well. Recommend this seller: I recieved this delivery on time and in excellent condition. Chaucer appeals to everyone: The Canterbury Tales is so appealing due to it\\'s diverseness. The Canterbury Tales by a modern hack poet: This set of CDs is a fraud! Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being got but a \"translation\" by some hack poet. Why is Chaucer so great?: Umm. Wait long enough and anything becomes a \"classic\": Here is the lesson to be learned: write a few dirty stories, wait a few hundred years and everyone will say you are a genius and that what you wrote is classic. For Simpsons fans. got by Martin Jarvis and a full cast: At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket\\'s shrine at Canterbury. Classic: In order to understand English litterature and the English language, many have got, or at least tried to got, Chaucers \"Canterbury Tales\". It\\'s a very through pocket delivery that can guide you in Laos: This is an excellent delivery for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. transliteration makes lao even more complex than it is: The Lonely Planet phrasedeliverys are usually a great help travelling around the world. insufficient to teach this tonal language: this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. No Lao-to-English!: This phrasedelivery looks reasonable in most respects, but it has no Lao to English dictionary. Yawn De Florette: This film is a BORE. Beautiful and touching: I must say that this was one of the most touching, tragic and beautiful film/delivery I\\'ve ever seen/got. A Feast for the Eyes and Ears: Jean de Florette is a beautifully made motion picture. Great product !: The performance of all delivary man, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. Wonderful Product. Definitely worth watching, although the lesser of two parts. WOW!: As I sat and watched this Product I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn\\'t take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the productline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors. Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo: I was greatly disappointed in this delivery. Too expensive to not offer carry handle/strap: Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio. love it: Thank you for making my baby happy, he is very into this type of music. VERY COMPELLING DOZIER ON ATTITUDE ,AND CHANGE: MILTON ROSENBERG,THE  Company OF WHOM I\\'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH, DOES A OUTSTANDING JOB OF EXPRESSING Fdelivary man,IN THE CONSISTENCY,OR LACK THREREOF CONCERNING HIS PHILOSOPHY OF CHANGE,AND THE VARIOUS ATTITUDE\\'S,LEADING UP TO THAT,Fdelivary man OF CHANGE. The closest thing to time travel: This is the first delivery since \"A Night to Remember\" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. Looking for a great delivery on Titanic? Don\\'t look here!: I study Titanic and try to get every delivery possible on Titanic,( I\\'ve been studying Titanc, way before the Product was made). Interested in the great ship? Don\\'t look here. 1986 NOT 1912: If you\\'re interested in the Titanic, this really is NOT the delivery for you! Pellegrino seems more interested in his own hiproduct, along with Bob Ballard\\'s, than he does with the Titanic\\'s. False facts and over-emotionalism detract from the product. The only reason I give it 2 stars is. Awful delivery: This delivery was horrible. Not the best: I have studied Titanic for many years, starting way before James Cameron\\'s film. This delivery is auful !!: If I could give this delivery a rating of less than 1 I would. False: I\\'m am an absolute fanatic of the greatest ship ever built. New facts learned and old ones enlightened: When I first saw this delivery in my local delivery store about a year ago, I thought: Great, another delivery on the Titanic giving the same old facts and the same stories that every delivery on the Titanic contain. Pellegrino is the best. Enlightening and spell binding: I got Titanic in the early part of 1997. its too drown out: Birthright uses the battle system rules that are o. Great: A good one. Lodge delivery: For the price of the delivery I was looking for more recipes not a hiproduct of cast iron cooking. the complete delivery of dutch oven cooking: this delivery spends too much time on hiproduct and stories. This is \"The Comlete delivery of Dutch oven cooking\": Or this is catalouge delivery and nothing more. THE GREATEST FILM SCORE IN THE HIproduct OF THE ProductS: THIS IS FANTASTIC SCORE FOR ANY KIND OF A Product, NOT JUST A CHEESY JAPANESE MONSTER Product! THE SCORE FOR THIS Product WAS NOT ON THE VERSION OF THE Product THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE USA IN 1962. Thoughtful Portrayal of Early 20th Century Rural Virginia: Ellen Glasgow is definitely an underrated American female writer; how many have heard of her? She writes elegantly and truthfully. Pulitzer Prize Winner: Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow deliverys. a pleasant reminder of the British Invasion: Listeners of this cd will be reminded that, in the era of just three guitars and a drummer, the British Invasion provided a pleasant change from American sounds in the early 1960s. A selection---we need a complete set of all they did. Great Bed. Looking forward to goting other deliverys by this  Company: This delivery was so fascinating that I could not take a break from goting it. buyer beware. Extremely cheap and poorly constructed, DO NOT BUY!: Everything about this scooter is incredibly cheap and shoddily put together. this scooter it only for kids scooter only 4 weeks: I am 22 years old men and i bought this scooter for the speed by ivoog scooters for 400 dollars with free shipping, and i like it,i have this scooter two months with problems, and the only big problem is that the wheels are very small to enjoy the ride safety,controller will stop working and then the company will leave you will not help ,and will tell you what could we do. So far so good!: The scooter has a good looking, the bateries last up to 45 minutes of continuos use but, need to change fuses evry long ride or every charging process, so far so good!. Dull and Annoying: A small town girl who comes to the city to become a star is a premise as old as the cinema. a teenagers opion: Ok I really like this Product I mean the product line was awesome. Piper is NOT Ugly!: Coyote Ugly is a sexy \"feel good\" Product. This Product was trite. Can&#65533;t fight the moonlight&#65533;: Okay, I\\'m a sucker for John Goodman, and he\\'s by far the sexiest in the cast. pure formula junk: This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. EXTRA SHARP CHEESE!: I\\'m all for a light entertaining Product but this thing was painful to watch. Coyote Ugly Is da bomb!: Coyote Ugly is the best film i have ever seen. Hate widescreen format: Loved the Product, bought the dvd and its in widescreen, its terrible. I want my money back: This Product is Flashdance with no flash, a Saturday Night fever on a Wednesday afternoon happy hour. Boring: My friend likes this Product so I checked it out. Birthday present for my niece. GREAT DANCING: The product line for this Product was different - something new - which I believe we all need in this day!The dancing & music was great - I have the sound track and I have the Product in DVD and watch it alot. Surprise! A good product: This film deals with two different plots: An aspiring singer and a bar named Coyote Ugly. Loved it: Don\\'t know why but can\\'t stop watching this Product. Entertaining: I like this Product. Great Product!: We all truly enjoyed this Product! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!. GOOD LOOKIN\\'!!: My girlfriend told me I had to see this Product, that I would love the \"eye candy\". Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad. Just another pretty face: This Product deserves every harsh review it gets. Greg\\'s Review: I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. A unique torture-technique: I saw COYOTE UGLY on an airplane from Germany to the United States three times, in English, in French, and in German. If only I could convince my wife: I was forced to watch this Product with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Unnecessary. These chicks think they\\'re so cool and tough: Yeah, let one of \\'em spend a day with Ted Bundy. Total cheese-fest: I can\\'t believe Products like this get made! This Product is CHEESY from start to finish. men are pigs: This is one of those Products that really disgusts me in the way it depicts women stutting their stuff and men drooling over them. Sexist film: Okay this is just another film for guys to watch hot girls strut around. Not worth buying. Cool, sexy and wild. Dumb Product: This was the biggest waste of time I have ever seen. Enjoy: I really enjoyed this Product and I bought the soundtrack and the dvd. How pitiful: I consider myself to enjoy a wide variety of Products. Excellent Product!: When you saw the previews for this Product, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. I love this Product: This product is really great for my trip. One of the Best Products I Have Ever Seen: I have watched this Product with my daughter about a million times over the last 5 years, and I can honestly say that it never gets old! The acting is top-notch, and I do believe that this is defintely John Goodman\\'s finest performance. I Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Get?!!!!!!!: I Have Seen The Original Coyote Ugly And Rate It Four And a Half Stars!Wonder How FUNKY This Is Gonna Be?It Is Probably Gonna Have Boobs,Butts,Nakedness,And LOTs More!So Definately Not Reccomended For Ages 1-9!. More true than most people realize: As an aspiring singer, I found this film to be closely related to the struggles that musicians go through. too much gyrating and not enought interest for me: Now, this is my mind on this Product. Iz love Tira but this is still abd: really boring dull cjhick flick that is awful. An Inspiration!!: This Product is one of the best Products i have ever seen. Cringeworthy. sticky sweet, predictable. Make it Stop!: My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. A nightmare!: I rented this poor excuse for a Product and couldn\\'t help falling asleep the whole time. good Product: I liked the Product I cant say it was better in HD but it was the first Product I saw on my ROKU player and was impressed. Love this Product: One of my all time favorite Products. this is jerseys Product: piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. Special effects?!: Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of Product bashing. This is a 2 star Product if you\\'re not a girl and under 16: This Product is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of Products becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I got the reviews for this Product and was very dissapointed. excruciating. Coyote Alert!: I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Good intentions. Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The Product stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. A waste of plastic and metal. Don\\'t go there: \\'Coyote Ugly\\' often gets compared to \\'Flashdance\\'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made \\'Flashdance\\' a success. Coyote Ugly ROCKS!: Coyote Ugly is one of the best Products i\\'ve seen so far. i hated this Product: I had the misfortune of paying my hard earned allowance on this Product. Good Picture-Great Audio: I was not so impressed with the video quality. Another tax-loss Product?: You know you\\'re watching a bad Product when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the Product before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run. Dont make me laugh, no really dont bother. A Great Sexy Product!: All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. It\\'s Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of goting reviews from people who think every Product should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I\\'ve seen in recent memory. Bruckheimer Should Stick With \"Guy\" Products. Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi Product delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. One of the most unbelievably vapid things I\\'ve ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this Product. really weak Film: nothing really happening with this Film. Stage Fright Is Not Genetic: Coyote Ugly is a Product about a young woman who moves from her father\\'s home in New Jersey to New York City to become a singer/songwriter. Like the first, but withoutt he dark edge. Garbage Sharpen Their Sound With Version 2. Great CD: Definitely my favorite band. I can\\'t get enough of this \\'garbage\\': Another collection of the hypnotic Shirley manon tunes. A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans: This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. Not as good as the first: With version 2. Is anybody here rating the Tab delivery instead of the album?: Great album. One of best pop/rock cds: Garbage is here again!!!! This cd is (little) better than the first and is worth buying. I LOVE THIS CD!!!: I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven\\'t removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. garbage is my favorite band!garbage is like alot of bands,: kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. One of the best C. I want to be Shirley manon!: This group has become my favorite. I love this CD!!! It\\'s awsome!!!!: I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!. One of the best CD\\'s of 1998!: Version 2. Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System. This CD ROCKS !!! This CD is GREAT GARBAGE !!!: Listen folks, you want a GREAT CD ! Garbage is version 2. There are only a couple of tracks that aren\\'t brill!!: Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don\\'t let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is \\'When I Grow Up\\'. version 2. This CD rules!: I love this CD. The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn\\'t worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. I liked it much more that the first CD. Nothing new here, just a Curve [copy] band. Weak. Garbage is exactly that. Ditch the Producer: Garbage\\'s first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. You Betta Buy This!: What a great album! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Absolutely Outstanding: I must admit that I\\'m addicted to \"Version 2. warning: this CD is extremely addictive: All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it\\'s the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is \"When I Grow Up. I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage. I was disappointed: Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. Garbage-Version 2. I\\'m a Garbage addict. Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. Temptation Waits. One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT GARBAGE. Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998. OH MY GOD GET THIS ALUBUM>>>ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!: It\\'s hard to top the first album that I got when I was 9 but this one almost does it. Garbage is the best Glam Rock band!: Heavy glam rock is what this band is all about. good cd: this is a really good cd. I agree: . Garbage Is Anything But. More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: \"I want Shirley manon to adopt me. Great CD!: I loved the first CD, but was doubtful about the 2cnd, since I\\'m used to the first CD being the better one. I never get tired of it!: Not many cd\\'s can grab your attention and keep it for very long. Brillent! Exellent! the best alblum, ever!: if you love garbage this is the one to have. Changed too much in too little time. Paranoiac. Love this CD!: I have loved Garbage for a long time now. You gotta love garbage: After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and goting reviews, I had to buy this CD. if ya like the first one, you\\'re gonna love this!!!!: This is a great CD and all I can say is that if you\\'re a fan of the first album. Good: I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2. pertty good: I do enjoy this ablum and would recommend it. the best album on the market: i started out taping garbage songs off the radio, till i figured out i could get them all on a cd. Great CD by a great group. An amazing follow-up. THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!: This CD is the bomb. New Type of Funk: new and exciting sound, very nifty beat. GREAT ,BRILLIANT ,SUPER!: I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it. A very \"Special\" album. Garbage is great!: Garbage\\'s first album was a without-a-doubt 5 star, probably my favorite album ever. Just when you think it couldn\\'t get any better. sticky: Garbage did it again! Another colletion of talented songs which sticks to your cerebral cortex and keeps you singing in the shower. Don\\'t forget to take out this Garbage!: I was unsure as to how Garbage planned to mutate their music to produce a whole new CD. AWESOME!: Let\\'s face it,Garbage\\'s self-titled \\'95 alblum was incgotable, but with Version 2. I loved every minute of the cd: I feel that version 2. this CD rocks!: This album is wonderful. Now THIS is music!: Wow what a prize to come out of the late nineties. One of the best albums ever made. Special CD: This is a wonderful CD, Shirley manon has a great voice, and the lyrics make you want to get up and dance. An amazing CD. Solid album: Most of us lost our virginity with Garbage on their first album, so it is kind of hard to top that one. This is the type of \\'Garbage\\' you don\\'t throw away!: Hello = )if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you won\\'t be dissapointed by it. Adds new fun to the track: The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son\\'s Brio track. Good addition to your Brio collection. Not PCI Port: I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. stinks: this thing smells and transfers the smell to your hands. A good season: I\\'ve watched One Tree Hill since the first episode the first season. Terrible season. cheaper at target: I purchased this set in early december paid over 40. This was a Great buy and a good shipment!: I recommend this product and i had no problem with the company that it came from. One Tree Hill Season 7: This was a good product overall. BOOTLEG: The boxed set I received was an obvious bootleg copy. One Tree Hill: Anyone can get into this show. One Tree Hill: Great cast. So Corny. One Tree Hill Season 7: This product was delivered at a reasonable amount of time considering it was international. very satisfied: The quality of the product was perfect. Very pleased: No problems with order! Received item within time frame. Love this show!: I love this show, I bought this season to complete my collection. Guardian Heroes 2 vs. Not long enough: This game is fast paced and action packed. Crappy Guardian Villains: Do you want a game that makes you frustrated? Do you want a game that gives you an excuse to throw your GBA at a wall and hit it with a hammer? Do you want a game, that makes you bang your head on a wall over and over again? If so, buy the game! If not, oh sweet mary do buy it! Please do not buy this! Please! This game is self-proclaimed to be a difficlulty level for children. Jula Bell gives me shivers: This is an absolutely wonderful and poignant CD. Sting\\'s the Star: The majority of cuts on the CD are run of the mill soundtrack fair. A Must for Kate & Leopold fans: The music on this cd is a lot like the Product. Excellent!: The soundtrack for \"Kate and Leopold\" is an excellent one, and the beautiful and dreamy musical segments evoke warm and happy memories of the delightful film and the scenes which are represented by the music. Not worth the money: The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song. Great Game for Young Kids: My kids ages 5 (boy) and 8 (girl) love this game! They are obsessed. It didn\\'t work. Amazon duped. Pac Man World 2: I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it. Jane Fonda in \"Julia\": I had not seen this film since its initial release and to see it again 30 years later was a real treat. Be aware!: This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe. Julia: I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I don\\'t understand all the hype over this: Another case of when I side with the minority. Compelling, wonderful film: I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. What happened to this DVD?: The date says January 1, 2010. Continuing enjoyment through the years: This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. fun at first but will get boring: only the first case is fun and the rest are stupid. Wow. I like the idea, BUT. yoga for surfers: don\\'t waste your money . Dont buy: This video is not good. Wow!: Yoga For Surfers is one of the best DVDs I own! I am convinced it is by far, the best yoga tape. Amazing!: For ten years I\\'ve had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. Don\\'t buy the dvd, and don\\'t buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews: I purchased this as a video, and was not that impressed. Great DVD: This is a great DVD, especially for someone who never did yoga before. Yoga For Sufers Review: As far as yoga instructional DVDs go, this is not one I would recommend. Nothing especially helpful for surfing: This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of \\'namaste\\' B. I Love this Video: I love this video -- everything about it is so true.

PLEASE got: This delivery does NOT contain a delivery key. very helpful: I have found this to be a very helpful workdelivery to go with Que Tal text.

Bright white: Installed these on my 2001 F-150 WOW a Big difference even in big city lights night driving, these bulbs really perform well. xtreme white plus bulbs: the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Save your money: These are not as bright as the Sylvania Silverstar Ultra and cost a whole lot more. I like em!: Put a set of PIAA headlamps on my Ford Ranger and woke up the night! Not too bright as to annoy on coming traffic but waaay better than the stock lights. Not enough bag for the buck: I have 2 2005 Dodge pickups the fdelivary many headlights suck, I bought a pair of these for one of the trucks. Disappointed: With the cost of these bulbs I was expecting a WOW when I turned them on, but only got a very slight improvement from the previous bulbs. PIAA are whiter: There brighter,whiter when I first used these I wasn\\'t to impressed. An Essential For CD Mixer\\'s!!: This double volume CD is a great tool for the begginer and experts DJ who mixes CDs. awsume: i got this just it time to winterize our camper its better than draining all the water and replacing with anti freeze. Rugged!: Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it. This is a great tool to help you winterize your RV: I used this tool to winterize our travel trailer. Too Restrictive to allow air volume needed. A great delivery with lots of room for improvements.

A tribute to the abilities of the WWII small carrier. Salty, irreverent, highly amusing: Clear the Decks!\"Salty, irreverent, highly amusing\" -- New York Times\"One of the best adventure tales of the war.

ORDOR GONE: This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. Del Shannon Shines: Del Shannon wrote some of the most distributing and depressing songs in rock music. got as fiction: You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this delivery.

Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It could be better: Thw writer has done a marvellous job, writing the hiproduct of USAAF in one volume only, in a modern and acesible language. An unbiased hiproduct: One of the best deliverys you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. Check the facts: I picked up this delivery because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. Not real hiproduct: This guy does not check his facts with primary sources and has many axes to grind. Lovely Like The Moon: Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon.

It is a truly captivating and memorable musical journey with this Jennifer Warnes album. Essential: This is an essential collection of Jennifer Warnes early work (pre-Famous Blue Raincoat) for enthusiasts. Excellent Recording Artist: Jennifer Warnes has always been a great recording artist and has made some fantastic titles songs for some of the greatest films in the past. OOPS. This \"Review\" Will Not Be Helpful: Is Jennifer Warnes doomed to do Product music to make a few bucks? With that crystal voice of hers, why doesn\\'t somebody write this broad some good commercial songs where she can show what she\\'s got?. Great Show - I was there!: Great DVD! I waited 6 hours for front row seats general admission. sad: a long time lou reed fan was so looking forward to recieving this dvd. This cd is absolutely awesome.

Just because she couldn\\'t do it: Doesn\\'t mean other women can\\'t. sad state of affairs: Checked this sad excuse for a delivery out at the library -- glad I didn\\'t pay for it. Where\\'s \"The Myth of Working Fathers\"?: The  Company\\'s message, in essence, is that working mothers are not \"real\" mothers. Misguided  Company: The  Company is attempting to justify her own choices by putting down working mothers. Ideological rant: This delivery is meant to make working mothers feel guilty while glorifying the stay-at-home mom. Piece of garbage!: The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. What a stupid delivery!: Don\\'t waste your money on this delivery unless you want to be insulted. Leaks: If your drive thru mud and rain expect water to get in this bag. I love this product: I have been searching the product like this for long time,I got one. Disappointing delivery.

HPL would be spinning: This delivery is okay, but Brown Jenkin is not what I saw when I got HPL\\'s \"Dreams in the Witch House. Started well, then.

KYLIE NOW IS A 2 HIT WONDER IN THE UNITED STATES!: Kylie is back in the States! Though she was never missing from the pop music world always making music.

I\\'ll never understand. Great Product!: This is a classic Mary Kate & Ashley Product. The Olsens\\' Products are just getting more and more pathetic!: I\\'m very, very sorry to say this, but THIS Product IS RIDICULOUS. Robert Clark and the Olsen twins: I saw this Product and i thought that the twins were really good. Really good and even interesting for adult viewing. Switching Goals is OK. Too Typical: You think that since these girls had done so many Products, they would have least done something more original than the \"twin\" switch. HAPPY: the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. The Best: As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. Pretentious: Found it stupid and annoying. I didn\\'t fall asleep. Quick got: Love Langston Hughes\\' poetry, but this was a nice departure.

Excellent sound: The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. I own one and I want another!!!: I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Definitive of what?: A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it\\'s hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn\\'t like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. How could this happen. This edition is full of errors, mistakes, and typos: DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. A classic delivery sold by weight not content: Many computer deliverys and study guides are sold on the basis that they are huge and - by implication - full of wisdom and knowledge. Most horrendous test prep delivery in press. This delivery is a Travesty: With just four years of chemistry background, I could write a better delivery than this in my sleep. Use with caution!: Poor chemists -- don\\'t you wish a delivery existed that could meet your needs at this level? This delivery, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. sloppy: The topics covered are generally clear, but there are numerous errors and typos. Wish I could give zero stars: Avoid this delivery at all costs. nothing but errors in this delivery: I agree completely with the other reviews of this delivery. I could have got a better delivery myself: The  Company\\'s alleged PhD is quite polemical. Monkies on typewriters: You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this delivery, I\\'d guess that Dr. Not so good: I had three deliverys to help study for this exam including this one. This delivery is the worst you could use for your GRE prep: This delivery is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don\\'t correspond. New to collecting? This will help. Lavishly illustrated, marvelous reference. Victorian Trade Cards: Historical Reference and Value Guide: A wonderfully got delivery on the topic of Victorian trade cards. AWESOME WORKOUT!: This is a great video and an awesome workout. sloppy: I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. Consider American Made Products: Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. Knock off: This is just a knock off of crocodile dentist. Item seemed like it was used not a new product!: Item seemed like it was used not a new product! Oh well it is just a cheap toy and the kids will probably tear it up in a couple of weeks anyway!.

Not as durable as I thought it would be. quick reflexes!: I\\'ve used this game with kids of all ages, including children with special needs. Fun, but fragile: My oldest got this for his 5th birthday. Just OK: I guess it\\'s my own fault for not really goting the description, but this thing is TINY. Cute!: Bought this for my 3 yr old boy, but my 6 yr old boy likes playin with it too. broken in days: I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Great for playdates, but a bit fragile: We are on our third crocodile dentist! It is a wonderful wonderful toy that my developmentally delayed preschooler and his typical friend all LOVE.

Broken right out of the box: At first the jaw didn\\'t close even after I pushed all the teeth in. Cheap Plastic: This toy did not last 1 day. Instantly broke: We had a larger \"Crocodile dentist\" toy that my 2 and 4 year old really loved playing with. Very small, flimsy and not working properly: Head gets stuck and does not snap. disappointed: We played with this gift three tiems and it broke. Not enough info: The description didn\\'t say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Bad purchase: This is not a very good toy. Horrible Quality: This isn\\'t at all like the Milton Bradley version, it\\'s VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. doesn\\'t live up to expectations: Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it\\'s size. piece of junk: We played this game twice and it broke. This Toy is JUNK!!!: I bought this toy for my Grandson for Christmas, because he asked for it.

This was the worst toy I have ever purchased: This was awful. Disappointed: My 7 year old son with special needs is very interested in anything related to dentistry (deliverys about going to the dentist, the deliverys Open Wide and Dr. Best game of all time: If you are looking for something fun for any age, look no further.

Cheap and works really well!: Bought a pair of these after goting about a little DIY someone did with the SonySony SS-B3000 deliveryshelf Speakers (Pair, Black)and adding a crossover to them. Beautiful music, lousy packaging: I was glad to see this disc reissued, even as a CD-R, but despite the beautiful music, I cannot recommend this disc because of the lack of any information other than the track listing.

Best show you\\'ve never seen: This is the last good show that MTV ever made. So Sad. Hilarious!: So many clever references in this show. Greatest animated show ever: This is the best animated series ever. Amazing: Loved this show eight years ago, still loving it now. I was lost, and then with Emanuel, I was found. Ultra-bad sound quality: This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Bowie and Ronson - nothing more need be said!: I have to chuckle at the perfectionists that diss this DVD because of the video quality. Classic Bowie and Ronson: This is one cool but dated video. glam rock at it\\'s best: A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. I\\'m a hardcore early David Bowie fan BUT: This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. Stardust Memories: If you like all that pre-grunge grunge dressed up in outlandish costumes and enough make-up to cause Angela Bowie blush, you\\'ll David and the Spiders ripping their way through their hits and a couple of covers including Mott the Hoople\\'s \"All the Young Dudes\" and Lou Reed\\'s \"White Light, White Heat. Don\\'t Get Me Wrong, I Still Love Bowie: The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie\\'s performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. Where in the world is the original mix?: I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. A nice DVD: I have this on both DVD and video and there isn\\'t that much difference. disappointing: One of the first DVDs I ordered and of those first few, the one I most looked forward to. Agree with Maltin: I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd. Ziggy stardust & the DVD from the rubbish bin: I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5. Camera work not 100% but great music all the same. The Best delivery In The World!!: I have got over 100 deliverys, but none as fabulous as this one. My nephews love them!: I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don\\'t fight with one another. More plastic toys, but they\\'ll have fun. pretty but delicate: this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is \"rolling\" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Mystical truth accessible to everyone!: What an awesome delivery!  Company Hilary Hart offers intimate and really moving encounters with eight contemporary and mostly hidden mystics from different backgrounds, like Buddhism, and Sufism. Great dada from the Bonzos!: Having heard most of the Bonzos\\' catalog (or catalogue, if you\\'re in the UK), off of assorted collections and the Cornology boxed set, I leaped at the chance to own the original CD\\'s (and this was the last one I purchased), because of the bonus tracks. Beware: I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. An Excellent Gift: I was given this delivery as a Christmas gift by a very good friend. Not as expected: Don\\'t be fooled by the title this delivery has nothing to do with the Stock Market. Color is not expresso!: We ordered the expresso - but the color is quite different. Beautiful music: Christopher Young is an amazing composer and performer. The Shipping News: I enjoyed the Product so much and loved the sound track, which I have really enjoyed and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys music with a Celtic sound. love this Product!: This is a great Product with an excellent cast and a beautiful score. Great performance!: This is a great performance by the one and only Babatunde Olatunji! If you are familiar with his music, you are probably a fan. Adds very little to the online docu: This delivery adds very little to the online documentation provided by the tomcat team and seems to be published in a hurry just to be the first tomcat delivery in place. Falls far short of expectations. Save your money. This delivery could have been something special. Good only for the beginners. Scott: While this delivery does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to got chapters. forget it for linux: The delivery seems to give a detatiled example of how to install on a windows platform, but who care\\'s, I want to install it on Linux! There is no detail to get you off the ground. Stick with the on-line docs: Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas. All this information is online. this should be titled \"An introduction to Jakarta projects\": If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. Best delivery on the subject: (. Not nearly enough detail: It seems as if the  Company tried to get the delivery out the door as quickly as possible. Great Text. Good lord! one of the WORST deliverys out there!: I\\'ve got a quite a few technical deliverys and by far, this one tops the list as being THE worst delivery I\\'ve ever got. Worthless: I bought this delivery when it was first printed hoping for some insight into how Tomcat worked, design decisions, architecture etc. Incomplete and not thourough: This delivery is very, very superficial. Great delivery, Especially the Apache SOAP Integration: I really got a lot out of this delivery. too expensive: The price for these 22 packets was several times more expensive than buying it in the 4 count package in a grocery store. Great product, worth the nasty taste: It took me a while to get used to the flavor: very bitter. Cinematic satire is dead: Tom Lehrer once said that political satire died the day Henry Kissinger was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Yes, this is a lame=weird Product: 1. God, This Product\\'s A Monster!: Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. ridiculously overrated campy trash: Only delivary man worth a hoot in this thing was B. YYYYAAAAWWWWNNNN: What in the hell was this???? I rented this mostly because of Brenden Fraser and based on the few reviews I got. Bad, bad, boring, bad: I couldn\\'t believe how bad this Product was. Yuck!: I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. Waste of Money: It was a waste of money. GET THE DVD BY ALL MEANS: The DVD has one of the best director\\'s and delivary man\\'s comments I have ever seen on a DVD. Stunning and brilliant: I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. Tender, wonderful Product: I can\\'t go on & on in quadruple paragraphs like some reviewers do, but I can say that this Product touched me & brought tears to my eyes several times. An intense and powerful Drama!: I purchased this Product because I am a huge Brendan Fraser fan, but the Product is so moving that I somewhat forgot that Brendan was in it and became so captivated in the product, that I ended up watching it again a second time. Ian McKellen shines hauntingly. Ian MacKellan was robbed at the Oscars!: He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded Product director James Whale (directed \"Frankenstein,\" \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and the 1936 \"Showboat\", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Good Product: Good Product, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror Products. Hollywood Queens and then some: A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down. Why?: I often Buy having not seen a Product, especially when the reviews are glowing. Boring,,,: Mckellen does such a poor job in this Product. A gay old man chasing a straight young man. Tender, Beautiful, and crack-me-up funny!!: This is a great Product. Great Character Study, Fascinating and Expertly Acted!: This Product has a great script and wonderful acting by all the cast, I was surprised that Brendan Fraser did a good job with his role. I know I was supposed to be impressed, but. A truly poignant, touching film: This is a fabulous Product adapted from a wonderful delivery. More than perfect: This Product is a masterpiece. A Wonderful Synergy of Pure Talent: This film is as poignant now as it was when I first saw it in \\'99, and am very glad to own it on DVD as one of my favourites. good: I have to say the Product was much better then I expected it to be. Kevin Bacon: As usual, Kevin Bacon does a great job playing someone who is not such a nice guy yet he manages to give his character some humanity. Boring, boring, boring!: Perhaps I\\'m just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Brad Renfro films are always good. No details = NO sale!: First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a Product with no reviews and/or no details about the release. POOR SUPPORT: I purchased this game and it would not work. Not Thrilled: I was disappointed with the amount of ON SCREEN displays there were and found it too distracting to even play. Perfect For Rainy Day Golfing: As a person who frequents the golf course on a weekly basis, I can confidently say that this game may give real golf a run for its money. don\\'t buy it: it has some nice features and it\\'s too bad that you can\\'t see them. don\\'t bother: As opposed to the listing and photo, this product has no provisions for headrests. Disappointed: I should have listened to the first reviewer. I did not receive the item: I did not receive this item. quite bad: I did not like this delivery at all - the  Company promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know. Sturdy, nice looking: I\\'ve had this outside my kitchen door for a couple of months. HORRIBLE: I would acttualy give it 0 stars. Realistic Tree: This Xmas tree is a very lifelike and realistic tree and is just what we wanted for our living room! The lights on it are beautiful and the pine cones are a great added effect. Christmas Tree, artificial: The GKI/ Bethlehem Ligh Glacier Christmas Tree is the first artificial tree that looks real and fools most of my guests. Great item but very tight fit: This item was perfect to replace my old worn out pad, only bit is its a very tight fit (no complaints to that as it means it won\\'t move or fall off) but have a screwdriver within reach to help get that final corner on to the brake pedal. Trading one bad habit for another: Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn\\'t know why at the time). This is actually better than the Live From New Haven DVD! 13 extra minutes. The voice of the lord: a sermon preached in christ church, georgeton dc: It was ungotable, your could not got any page. Bullet Proof your relationship and build attraction at the same time!: Are you a single or married guy, trying to figure out how to deal with your girlfriends\\'/wives\\' mood swings? Then I have a delivery for you, its called \"How To Be A 3% Man, Winning The Heart Of The Woman Of Your Dreams\" It\\'s the best delivery Ive ever got, dealing in relationships, from the masculine point of view. Padding, Padding, Padding: I have no idea whether this delivery has anything of worth to offer because all I found was worthless padding. Just great!: I\\'ve got few dating deliverys from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Just imagine the possibilities: Imagine your life with the woman you always wanted. Babe: Enough said. Excellent Biography: An engrossing, informative biography of baseball\\'s greatest player. Still The Best: Originally published in 1974, Creamer\\'s delivery was the first \"serious\" biography of Ruth and remains the standard work on the subject. Babe: The Legend Comes To Life: As  Company of the yet to be published \"Babe Ruth: The Man Behind The Legend,\" I have got every delivery I can find on the subject of Babe Ruth. Babe Ruth learned: As being a Generation X-er, I always heard stories of Babe Ruth being the best slugger and his 714 home runs. Still the Sultan: I really enjoyed this delivery. Good Foundation: I found this delivery to be packed with great information and recommend it to be added to any PHA library. Very Nice Watch for exceptional price: Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. worked perfectly!: After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Not the best I have: I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. very poor quality: This item is on sale, for a reason. Great Price, Great Product: Love these and easy to use. Office Max wants $40 for this: It works on my laser printer. for laser printers only: This product is for laser printers only. Great little known tips: I am an avid gardener who has accumulated many deliverys on the subject. Good service: I was pleased with the condition of the delivery and the speed with which I received it. Great photographs. Fantastic show: My husband and I have come to love this show. The Review: Kenichi is definitely worth buying. Blah. Great Beginning--Disappointing in Total: I loved the first chapter of \"Surrender. This wallows in lameness!: The title of the review says it all. We aren\\'t in Kansas anymore: I enjoyed \"Surrender Dorothy\" very much. Surrender this one: After plodding through a few chapters of these boring characters, I surrendered the delivery to the stack waiting to go back to the library. Absorbing and Felt Real: This absorbing product felt real as I went along, goting it pretty quickly over the course of a few nights. Boring,Boring,Boring,,,: How an  Company can create such great characters while writing a novel free from compelling circumstances is surprising. funny and heartbreaking: I loved this delivery -- it\\'s among Wolitzer\\'s best. Would not buy were I you: The delivery\\'s horrendous, a waste of money. Disappointed: I got this delivery and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it\\'s basically the same old stuff not very interestingly got. Left me cold: Okay, I\\'ll admit it was sort of scary, but it got on my nerves how completely unlikeable the characters were. Reflections of a Vampire ROCKS!: Horror lovers everywhere, be prepared to crown another King. Big Chill in Little London: A word of mouth film. A little disappointed. For those who like word of mouth cult Products. Trash Pure and Simple: This is one of the worst conceived, plotted, edited, or acted films it has ever been my misfortune to buy. For professionals only: If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this delivery has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. Not as well-made as I\\'d hoped: The three bears on this toy spin easily, which makes it great for a young baby to play with. Not up to expectations. Everything I ever wanted to know: This dictionary is the best medical dictionary I\\'ve come across. Mosbys medical dictionary: Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures. mosby\\'s dictionary: it\\'s been very helpful, i\\'m taking medical coding and there are things i did not know so i looked it up and was very helpful. Better Lucky than Smart: I ordered Tabers Cyclopedic guide first, but it arrived with some pages damaged in binding. This dictionary makes looking up words fun. Mosby\\'s Medical Dictionary: I am enjoying the delivery. Mosby\\'s Medical Dictionary: This dictionary was bought for my wife studying to become a LicensedMassage Therapist. Mosby\\'s Medical Dictionary 7th Ed: I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. Cap in Terrell, Tx. Much Is Missing: This particular Dictionary does not come with conversion tables, or any of the other information that is advertised with this purchase. Mosby\\'s Medical Dictionary: This dictionary is a great resource. Easy to understand: I bought this delivery to compliment my Taber\\'s Medical Dictionary. I finally found it: My search is over. One of the most disappointing Heinlein deliverys: This delivery seemed like just another rehash of the basic training productline from Starship Troopers. A child\\'s adventure product; an adult\\'s classic: It\\'s too easy to dismiss Heinlein\\'s juveniles as deliverys for kids. One of Heinlein\\'s better Children\\'s Stories: This delivery is an excellent adventure in the Heinlein series. A monologue on shortfalls of general-ship and the war of 1914-18: JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent got. OOPS!: I know it says outdoor but I thought since the fire was caged. DOUBLE MEASURE!: Putting things in perspective is only part of what Eduardo learns as he attempts to \"measure up\" to the RULERS. Mediocrity for our times: The  Company uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Command and Control at the Top: Like many others, I picked up this delivery hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. Misses the Point: I was hugely disappointed with this delivery. Good Godowsky. Horrible: I own the Swissmar Borner V Slicer and find it to be of exceptional quality (very sharp and useful). Almost awful product from Borner!: I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. Borner Veggie Peeler: I used to have this peeler, but it was misplaced during moving. Not Vermont American: You may think you are buying Vermont American quality, but what you will receive is the brand \"Do It Best\" crap FROM CHINA. Afterthoughts . VERY HARD TO FIND 1982 RELEASES! BUT VERY GOOD ONES!: I remember living in Inkster, MI on Parkwood Avenue and my friend Rod would be bumpin\\' this 1982 release every day. Good Bed: Good bed. Tore within a few days. Too noisy!: The combination of the cedar and the nylon made this bed incredibly noisy. Great group, poor dvd: Dvd was dissapointing. crosby stlls and nash live in LA 2007: DVD is not a 2007 concert but one in the 1980\\'s. Santana - Live by Request: War Of The Worlds will about blow my windows out. Nothing New!! Same as SuperNatural but. Still Amazing: Watching Carlos Santana and his band on this DVD brings to me a special enjoyment. Nutritious and delicious: Though one reviewer felt the format of this delivery was a poor choice, I found it to be perfect. Recipes for a Small Planet: Great delivery for vegetarian recipes. Nearly Useless: I\\'ve owned this cookdelivery for years. Bought it again for our second child!: These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. Good: This is an excellent item. They didn\\'t live happily every after: Faith Wish is a great delivery that mature teenaged girls can relate to. Not good: If I hadn\\'t promised to review this delivery for our school library, I would have stopped goting after the first chapter. beautiful dancing: I wasn\\'t sure if I\\'d be able to relate to Aradia after seeing how professional she always looks in her magazine photos, but having got all the other reviews, I took a chance and bought this dvd. So simple, yet so fun: We went to a pool with a dear friend. Put holes in our pool liner: We loved this toy at first . Not true to description!: Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section. Excelente: Manu es una de los mejores cantantes del Operacion Triunfo. Touching, sad, but moving and worth the got: Although many people think that goting such deliverys as these, the accounts of teenagers who died while under the Nazi regime, is depressing. I don\\'t like it: IT WAS SOOOOO BORING. We Are Witnesses: When I picked up this delivery and thought I would be goting experts from the dairies of David, Yitzhak, Moshe, Eva, and Anne but I was wrong. This is a good delivery: I am a sixth and I\\'m goting a delivery about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. Ok I guess: This delivery was OK. delivery=Very GOOD!: I thought this delivery was very good and descriptive in what happened to the teenager\\'s lives and the victims of the Holocaust. Outstanding CD: I have all 4 cd\\'s - now waiting for the new cd, November 24 . Caught the fever!: I was introduced to this band by some friends. Sent wrong delivery: I ordered Introduction to Social Problems (6th Edition)and they sent me Introduction to Sociology (5th edition). A flimsy and heavily biased account of problems in America: Thomas Sullivan attempts to cover a broad array of social problems confronting American society. One of the great medieval Jewish poets and thinkers: Solomon ibn Gabriol 1021-1058 is one of the great Jewish medieval poets and thinkers. Crack: I gave it to a friend. all cracked up: Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn\\'t know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can\\'t get full refund. AWESOME Product A MUST SEE: I Loved this Product Plain And Simple It is A MUST SEE. Good beginning, bad ending: This delivery\\'s first chapter was good. A plain and simple NASB. Poor quality. NASB: Most probably the best Bible I have owned. Fun, suspenseful Product: This DVD is in fine condition and the Product is well done as well as exciting and fun to watch. Why so much?: I\\'ve heard of this Product and was interested in picking it up. Was he?: The product of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the German that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. A Dead Hero!: This has got to be one of the best WWII espionage films I have seen. The Man Who Never Was: Although later historical facts have put a few holes in the details of this CD and the original delivery, the content was in the main true to the actual happenings. A Classic British WWII Film: This film showes the Brits as the Masters of faking out the Crowns Enemies. I\\'m glad the man never was, I wish the Product never was either!: Adopting the product of operation \"Mincemeat\" from World War II, this Product shows the details of a very successful mission to deceive the Axis alliance. Dull as Lead: Thirty minutes into the film, viewing it in w/s, I ejected the disc. Fantastic, because it based on a unbelieveable true product: If this was a fictional product it still would be a good product. The Man Who Never Was: This one of the iconic British Products from the 1950\\'s. A good quality WWII Product bases on a true product: To think that British Intelligence created this allusion to fool the Nazis during World War II is just magnificent. Cheers for The Man Who Never Was: I had always tought of clifton Webb as that weird guy who starred only in The Stars And Stripes For Ever, A 1950\\'s verson of The Titanic and Cheaper By The Dozen. An exciting World War II Product: I rate \"The Man Who Never Was\" as an excellent and exciting World War II Product. Incredibly slow, boring thriller based on a fascinating true product: I couldn\\'t make it past the first ten minutes. Live Suprise!: This is a Live CD, which I did not expect since the product info does not specify that. Wrong item!: After receiving the cd in the mail, I opened it up and played it, and swore they shipped the wrong cd. from a doula dad: The tips for first time mom and dad are very helpful. A few good, a lot bad: There are maybe 3 good Products in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive Products. Ballets of the Forties and Fifties described. Al Green Love and Happiness: This is a classic CD set. Tight Jam by R. Surface Noise!!!!!!: Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. This Is Crap: If you have no other way to hear this music, then go ahead and buy this cd. It was a fiction delivery. Way too many ads: In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. Men\\'s Fitness: Men\\'s Fitness has some great workout/exercise tips as well as some good dieting tips as well. fitness: It\\'s very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Cancelled Subscription: I\\'ve been a long time subscriber to Men\\'s Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. Great magazine: Loaded with workout tips and guides (even if you think you know it all). Six months past, I never get the magazine. Don\\'t Order this product: The magizine itself was good with the one issue they sent. Awful Service: Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!. Not as good as it once was: I\\'ve been a longtime subscriber to Men\\'s Fitness. Its all shell. Pretty sad, fake pictures and nearly all adds. Review of Introductory Circuits for Electrical and Computer: I\\'m sorry to say this but this delivery is absolutely horrible. Don\\'t waste your time: I\\'m a second year EE engineering student with 20 years of electronics background in repairing, circuit analysis, and troubleshooting. Really bad!: This text delivery is absolutely horrible. Not good: This delivery is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. Required for course: This delivery was required for a course, and the previous reviewers are correct. Hidden Gem!!: After listening to tracks off this CD on KKSF in San Francisco 15 years ago, I decided to search high and low for one of the last albums on the Columbia label by the jazz piano legend. Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN: This is by far the worst delivery I have ever got on this topic. False Intimacy has false determinations about God & sex: This delivery was a complete turnoff. An abomination: I\\'m a Stanford-trained MD and practicing psychiatrist and I have to say that this delivery is worse than terrible. Review of False Intimacy: The delivery, False Intimacy, arrived in excellent condition and it\\'s content is truly amazing and informative. Average sound and vision , music slick but involving: Most of Roxy\\'s fans will buy all their DVD\\'s as each of them offers a different lineup of the band and different songs . Great DVD: I have had the video tape of this Roxy Music performance for years. doesn\\'t come with what\\'s pictured. Thought Provoking. Meh. totally unnecessary: this product is ridiculous. I don\\'t think this works. Best Flamenco Album of Azucar Moreno: Azucar Moreno is a Spanish band with 2 lead lady singers. Handy lil mp3 player: I bought the 512mb for my daughter. Santa\\'s gone surfin\\'. Delivers what it promises. Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided: I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Character sheets with different pictures: Well, I expected this to contain a bunch of character sheets customized for the different occupations. great material hampered by poor layout: Somewhere in this great hiproduct delivery there\\'s a game. Poor scholarship: This delivery is another example of \"hands-off\" scholarship in that it appears as if the editor never visited Montgomery but rather relied on secondary sources. Helpful delivery on Pastors Changing Churches: Paul Robbins is the editor of this delivery, but each chapter is actually got by a different person. Good To Go: This album is great man. Predictable and Unrealistic: I decided to got this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. most intense delivery i\\'ve ever got !!!: I got Disturb not the dream maybe fifteen years ago. One of the all time best gots ever!: I got this maybe 20 years ago, and have to got it again. Interesting yet fairly predictable and corny: I got this delivery as a result of goting the reviews at this site. Disturb not the dream: I have got this delivery several times. Old favorite: i first got this delivery back in the 1980s and loved it. From the lyrics to the chords, this album is full of talent: These Anaheim boys know how to rock my world. This delivery should be on our shelves as Pastors: I cannot imagine a less user-friendly layout than the Word Biblical Commentary Series. Awesome baby prunes!: My daughter loves these! The only thing I wish they would change would be to make the package recyclable. Historical and family content a MUST got!!!: I loved this delivery. Do not got this delivery!: It has been a while since I got this delivery, but I absolutely hated it. SUTURE SELF: Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Mysterious hospital deaths: Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. Time to quit series!: I have got each Bed & Breakfast thru #25. get what you pay for: Fine item, does what it needs to, the wires are small but works just fine. Early learning toy: My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. Requires too much strength for toddlers: The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate. Great easy toy: My twins love this toy. not safe and no fun: once you get this toy in your hands you can see the cheap construction--the buttons don\\'t work smoothly and the egg-tops are easy to pull off: just the right size for my toddler to pop in his mouth! i chucked this one right in the garbage. Of little interest: My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. She is a good singer. eh What was I thinking?: Ok I loath britney and Christina. An excellent debut CD!: If you are considering purchasing Stacie Orrico\\'s first CD \"Genuine,\" I would highly recommend it. Stacie rocks!!!!!!: This CD is a must buy. The Best: This is the best CD ever. So Cool!: This CD is great! It\\'s lyrics, sound, and beat make it a much better choice than Oops! I did it again! or Christina Agulara! This CD is suitable for all ages! But, because of the message behind certain songs such as \"Dear Friend\" and \"Everything I Have\" it would do a lot more good for Junior High and High School age groups! Make sure you listen to the track \"Stay True\". Awesome CD!!: Stacie Orrico is one talented teenager! I have to say, I was very surprised to find she was so young! I think it\\'s wonderful and refreshing to have someone like Stacie Orrico in Christain Music. Satisfied: I paid 50 cents for this. WONDERFUL: I Love this CD. this cd is tight: Stacie Orrico is Christian\\'s Britney Spears. Totally Awesome!: Stacie Orrico is the best. Pretty Darn Good Stuff: I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. skeptical about pop music. Is this Christina??: This CD is amazing! Her voice talent is amazing! She will remind you of Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, I also feelA little bit of Mariah Carey in this CD! I would reccomend it to any one!. Great Saw At First But Don\\'t Use Too Often: I Bought this saw about a year ago and thought it was wonderful. disappointing got: Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat. A personal insight to physical and mental perseverance. A pleasure to got!: This delivery really is a must have for the PCT collector. New meaning to the term \"thin\"!: Description of the comforter does point out that it is lightweight that would be an understatement. Priced Right: We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. Lightweight and Warm: The comforter is not lofty, but does \"fluff up\" nicely. ok for the price: This comforter is ok for the price. Stands the test of time: This was a very good got. I wont have that husband!!: This is a fabu delivery. Good got!: Diary of a Mad Housewife is a really enjoyable got. Great mastery of domestic details. very basic self talk: This CD was really only an overview of self talk, and didn\\'t provide any real self talk, like a Shad Helmstetter or other more well known writer. Powerful Self-Talk, Change Your Self-Talk, Change Your Life: Michael J. This is not the screenplay: This is the script for the stage play, which has been updated for modern times. Really makes a difference: Limbsavers reduce the kick of large calibre mil surp rifles. His Second Album: Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. real country: I waited years for the vinyl to finally be released on cd. a good historical delivery: if you like hiproduct deliverys got this, if not dont waste your time its boring from beginning to end but it gives you a good idea of what life was like for afro\\\\amer. Great Smoke Taste: Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. Bradley Special Blend Bisquettes 48 pack: These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great. Good flavor to meat. Woodlands Smoker: Bradley products always perform great in my smoker. Awesome Product!: We love our smoker and we love the smoker chips/bisquettes! The Bradley Cherry Bisquettes add a great flavor to Chicken, pork and beef! They are cheaper on Amazon than at Bass Pro or Cabelas. Bradley Pecan Bisquettes: They worked as advertised . A great comfort: Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. Worst CD I bought in 5 years: I preordered this CD. Gimme a break: This is ridiculously preachy stuff. Spare us the Preachy Folk Crap!: Ry Cooder is an incredible musician, but that does not automatically make you a great songwriter or a great album maker. quite boring. Buddy: I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder. Warms the heart. Ry\\'s best work: This is an amazing disc. Ry Cooder: As an avid music fan with an abiding interest in the origins of popular music, I was again astounded by Ry Cooders ability to depict graphically the mood and sounds of the 30\\'s. Ry Cooder My name is Buddy: I do like the atmosphere on this CD. Buddy the cat is the best: I heard about the CD with clips and an interview with Ry Cooder on NPR and immediately ordered it. 1 month to ship?: I ordered it on april 11, now it\\'s apr. Great product: This is a very good product. Nice but not the best: I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. Great for smoothing and repairing sensitive skin: Some days my skin is very oily and other days it is dry. Fair: It is a very fair tribute to Celia. Excellent: So interesting! This product is excellent. DVD CON PROBLEMAS: ESTE DVD LLEGO EN BUEN TIEMPO. Regret Purchase: It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. The best of recent deliverys on Wordsworth and Coleridge. Good overview of bgots in the world, not a good recipe delivery: This delivery starts with the usual \\'bgot delivery\\' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bgot,equipment etc. World Encyclopedia of Bgot: Excellent delivery for beginners. Worst dubbing ever!: Fast beat motivating music. camco wrench: This is a great tool. Inaccurate description: My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. an almost necessary tool. Wasn\\'t what I wanted: This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. The ad didn\\'t say what size this thing was: I ordered this wrench assuming it would fit my water heater drain plug. Did Not Work For Me: Not at all what I needed because it did not fit. plastic tool: works ok but not really enough clearance to use on the water heater valve and is made out of plastic. Did not fit my Coleman E3: This appears to be perfectly fine as long as it fits. great stuff: These are just the beat scrubbies I\\'ver used. Chore Boy Golden Fleece: I grew up using these on dishes (mainly pots and pans) because my mom always said they work the best at getting off stuck on food without ruining your pans. Golden Fleece is the BEST: Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. Raised body temperature and metabolism: This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and \"cold body syndrome\" which is related to low thyroid. not a healthy product: I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. It made me gain weight. Was Larry alive when he made this? Terrible!: 1. Should put his talent to better use. What happened to Larry Carlton?: The elevator has arrived. What\\'s with all the complaining?: Ok, after goting some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. Larry\\'s Careful New Album: I\\'ve been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the \"Sleepwalk\" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. The obligatory contractual album: It is unbelievable that Larry Carlton could churn out such an album that is bereft of ideas and imagination. Chrysler/Blower: This product is exactly what is pictured and fit perfectly. Crap: This dvd was in some other region format, wouldnt even play on my dvd player. the Product rocks, BUT. Didint understand much: I\\'m not sure what the plot was for this Product, I really don\\'t know what i got the Product either maybe i wasn\\'t in the right frame of mind or maybe it was cause of the sex scenes? i don\\'t know but wasn\\'t all that great. Dance with the Devil: This Product was ridiculously overpriced. A Waste of a Picture: This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. A Piece of Trash: This is the worst Bardem-Perez Product that I have seen. So bad. Great Product, but. Be aware!: Don\\'t blow 35 bucks on this because it says it\\'s \"unrated\", here. Miller\\'s overlooked art: Steve Miller is probably the world\\'s most underated guitarist. THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE: Is a really good delivery!!! Easy for kids to learn. I am yet to receive this delivery, first time I ever had a problem: I am disappointed that the delivery has not yet come. Lysenko in music: Welcome to the nonsensical ramblings of the Trofim Lysenko of US musicology, Joseph Kerman. WONDERFUL delivery: If you didn\\'t want to take the time to got the review by Stan Moore, take my word for it. VERY TEEN-MUSIC CD: I really Like This CD because I like this kind of \"Teen Music\". Brimful of Styles: We algoty knew that Cornershop represented a unique brew of styles. Not Impressed: Not to impressed that there is a picture of a girl on the cover, yet its a guy who is doing the teaching. Rip Off: First, the DVD was produced in Germany, and you have your choice of the instructor speaking in his native German or dubbed into English. An Acquaintance with darkness: A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Pretty Good: I really liked this delivery! It is a Classic \"Rinaldi\". Excellent content, Very easy goting, Historically correct!: I really enjoyed this delivery. An Aquaintance with Darkness: Emily Bransbury\\'s mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. This delivery was Phnomenal: This was Ann\\'s best delivery yet. The Madness of Life: In this delivery Emily\\'s world crumbles beneath her feet when her mother dies. One of the Best: I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. Dark is right!: A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to goting this delivery. Truly an \"Acquaintance With Darkness\": This a dark and mysterious delivery about an interesting and unthought of topic. First thought, bummer, as I got on more like Bravo!!!: The first paragraph or so , it was like Mrs. A Very Suspenseful delivery!: This delivery not only kept me goting and goting, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. This delivery was very good I loved the suspense: there wasn\\'t enough romance though. A Disappointment: I am a professional player and teacher with students ranging from beginner to adult. Poor!: I bought this to listen to a sax play better than me. Watch by Moonlight: This was a very good delivery, while not excellent. A Necessity for any Lovebird Owner: Do not purchase a Lovebird until you got this delivery! This delivery is filled with important information. Excellent delivery for those who own companion lovebirds: A visit to my local library yielded many deliverys about breeding lovebirds, with little focus on the pet owner who wished to keep a single lovebird just as a pet. Good delivery for pet owners, but not breeders: If you\\'re getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great delivery. Smooth and cool, like the anime series!: This CD is hi-tech and sharp and jazzy. Vitaminless?: The version of this CD that includes \"Vitaminless\" is a bootleg. Not woryh a plug nickle: Useless, just a junk kit. Not what it claimed to be: The pic was so small - couldn\\'t see that it was exclusively screws - no nuts at all. okay: the keychain is useful and works good, so if you are getting this to tighten up your glasses, its great. Typical Imported Product: The case is pretty much useless. Nice kit: Everything you need to fix your glasses. Screws do not have heads!: I was quite surprised to find that about half the screws in this kit were defective in that they did not have any cut in the head for a screwdriver. Must Have foer Anyone with Glasses or Sunglasses: I have a few very expensive pairs of sunglasses (won\\'t buy expensive ones ever again) and this kit was exactly what I needed to tighten the screws that are constantly coming loose or falling out. Doesn\\'t smell like plumeria. Nice lighter version of Tresor: This is a nice lighter version of Tresor for the summer. Good Enough I\\'m Looking for the  Company: Help! My cousin in Brazil is trying to contact the  Company of this delivery. Fox Collection: The Great Fox War Products (Patton - Special Edition / The Longest Day / Tora! Tora! Tora! - Special Edition)I purchased this set and the DVD\\'s (6) Were Damaged. Can\\'t vouch for content, but packaging is really nice: As I said in the title, I can\\'t vouch for the content as this was purchased as a gift for my Dad. Not the best deal. classic bit of entertainment: Adventure Product based on delivery, pretty much plot for plot. Not the best choice. AAARGH!: Avoid this game. Worst 3D shooter I ever played: I paid $2 for this at Gamestop. To the point: Sufficient detail and a whole lot of information - perhaps too much information, it\\'s a thick delivery - to plan ski tours, generally for lightweight touring gear, e. A disappointment: This is not a good atlas at all. WIll work with new drivers: My brother and I have had to split our time on the internet for a while. Not goty for Windows seven: Had great connection and was REALLY fast. Works Great: I installed this card in my computer running windows 7 64 bit. A little trouble connecting but works fine: I got the card into my computer and installed the software, just as the user guide suggested. Really good value for the money: I needed a wireless card for my desktop PC as it was moving to another room and I don\\'t currently have the time to run a coaxial connection in there for the cable modem. Satisfied Customer: I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. Vista Home Premium 64-bit SP1 easy install: After goting past reviews, I was prepared to have to download special 64-bit drivers to make this card work with Vista 64-bit. Stable and fast!: I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. leet product: This thing can pick up signals better than anything I have used. Easiest route I have ever installed!: I noted the opinions of previous raters of this product and decided to give it a try. Works well, but antenna cable is a little short. Works Good. Fastest so far!: Bought this to install in a 40 Gig, HP Pentium 4 hard drive government surplus computer that is about 2-3 years old. Weak Signal: I purchased this because of the good reviews. GREAT!!! and slow cost!!! BUT!!: This product works great once you figure out how to connect it. did not work: The card did not work. Very Fast Wireless Card: I am using this card with a Windows XP 32 Bit operating system, the card installed without a hitch and is faster than I expected. Works with Vista 64: I loaded this up today and out of the box it did not work with vista 64, I had to go on another computer and go to MSI\\'s website to get the vista 64 drivers. Works with XP 64!!!!: I tried so many different cards and combos trying to get my newly built Shuttle cube PC to work with XP 64 on my wireless network. Works great: This item works great. Works Great!: This little card installs flawlessly on Windows 7 and then just works like a champ. Easy to install. Good product. Reliable, Fast, and Inexpensive. Great Wireless PCI card: It is a wonderful and for the price, nothing can beat it. Incompatible with windows7: OK, I bought this card after goting all the nice reviews, but in fact, it sucks. antenna sucks! I recommend a more modern antenna!: okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy. Not Worth It: This product constantly connects and disconnects every two seconds. Doesn\\'t work: This product will come up with the networks in the area. DO NOT BUY!: 1) Too many options to make it run smoothly. Keeps dropping the connection. Works great on Vista 64-bit: NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network. crc receive errors: Installation was relatively simple, but the receiver seemed not sensitive enough for the location.

Simple Installation: I received and installed this last night on my kids 4 year old HP desktop. Excellent signal: A few points I\\'d like to share:1. Talk about plug and play!: I have windows Vista to start with. Works great with Windows 7: Just got this card for my new Windows 7 machine. Works great!: I had a wireless USB adapter, and it does not compare to this! Easy to install and hasn\\'t dropped signal on me yet. Does not work with Windows Vista & Airport: Tried and failed to get my pc set up on our Airport 802. Works great with my Compaq Presario with Windows Vista sp2: I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn\\'t detect my router. Works Great!: I had a Linksys wireless receiver that was not compatible with Vista, so after upgrading my computer, I found this on Amazon and based on reviews, decided to give it a shot. Works great: I added this to my windows vista desktop. lost settings: Works great most of the time. Total garbage! Software terrible. Works, but with limitations. Works great: This product works really good. It works!: I bought this because my crappy D-link wireless pci adapter was dying only after about 6 months into use. Very Dissapointed: This is a delivery that has a chapter on the Breed itself. Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics. Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics. Waste of money: This program does have some good hiking information but it is not very user friendly at all. DONT BUY FROM AMAZON!!!: this is a good reciver but i got it at circuit city for 120. Great product: This is a great product for the price. Outdated but Great for Essays, Papers, and Editing: I value this delivery since I proofgot papers, essays, administrative memos, etc. a valuable resource: if you need to have clarity regarding the usage of the got word, this delivery will be a valuable, easy to use reference. Simply the best: I teach business writing in industry and government, and I recommend the Gregg Manual enthusiastically in all my programs, at every level. delivery review: great delivery a lot better than I excepted. An invaluable style and reference manual for advertising copywriters: This is the best style manual for advertising copywriters on the market. Simply the Best!: Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. Boo! Stay away from this product: Such a great idea, perfect in its simplicity, and yet executed so horribly. Hard to see answers under buttons: I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. Perfect for a first grader: great for a child just learning basic math concepts. No batteries calculator!: My husband had these as a kid. Use product in bright light: I bought this toy for my daughter, I remember playing with this at a cousins house as a child. Great learning toy!: Bought this for my niece, as I had one similar as a child and she loves it as much as I did! It\\'s a fun way to learn addition and subtraction!. Plus-Minus Chart Toy: Big problem. Useless: I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. out of stock?: When item was ordered it was in stock I waited 4 days that I could have ordered another item just to be emailed out of stock. Arrogant  Company: I found that the style of the delivery was more about the  Company showing off his knowlege, rather than presenting the information. AWESOME Writer - Not updated for all of Java2. ONLY FOR PROGRAMMER: I got this delivery for my programming class and I had no programming experience before. It is pretty bad: I am a computer Science student at the university of new brunswick and i felt that this delivery was a complete waste of time. A good source of propaganda!: I have learned Java from \"Core Java\". Great delivery - easy learning: I loved \"Just Java 2\", and found it a great tutorial on all the key aspects of Java. Vague: This is not a good Java delivery. Lacks depth. I am surprised this delivery is endorsed by SUN: This delivery does not have any order, take a look at the chapter \"FILE I/O\", after goting that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. Not Practical: This delivery leaves much to be desired. Its little hard. Great delivery. NOT so good: Not a very good delivery to learn Java. The best programming delivery I\\'ve ever got: I\\'ve struggled with a lot of mumbling-jumbling programming deliverys and wondered why programming delivery can be so boring and difficult. Just Java 2: Excellent delivery, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java. Not as good as his delivery \"Deep C Secrets\": I believe Peter Van Linden is one of the best  Companys out there, and his delivery titled \"Deep C Secrets\" is one of my favorite. Great delivery for existing programmers: This delivery is great for people (like me) who can algoty program, and just want to learn Java. Excellent intro to Java and OOP for newbies. Do not buy this delivery unless you know C++: I thought I\\'d be able to learn Java from this delivery, but after a few chapters I was totally frustrated by the way the  Company attempts to teach you Java in terms of C or C++, neither of which I know, neither of which are necessary to learn Java. Should be Java for C/C++ Programmers: The title of this delivery should have been, \"Java for C/C++ Programmers\". Not a very thorough delivery: This delivery has some excellent reviews.

Don\\'t waste your hard-earned money: This delivery is an absolute waste of money. Not bad, but not for newbies: This delivery is great for those with previous OO experience (or at least a strong knowledge of C programming), but for those who are new to programming, I would recommend trying The Java Tutorial by Campione, et al. Easy to got, but NOT a good reference: Just Java 2 is very gotable, but it does not do a very good job of teaching Java or OOP. Great for C Gurus. Great Activity delivery - Cover Questionable: This delivery is great for little active hands. Cheaply made: Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. I was skeptical, but they work!: I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Costly but good: This trainning pad is the most absorbant I\\'ve ever seen. Excellent Product, poor quality DVD, poor quality video: My wife and I really enjoyed this delightful Product about two friends and their developing relationship.

Journey To Hell: This is actually a retitled and edited version of John Bunyan\\'s, \"The Life and Death of Mr. Did not learn much: Instant Immersion French is poor when it comes to teaching you French. Really should be zero stars: This product is really a disappointment. Worthless: It should have got 0 rating. Next time got the item description Edgardo: This is not a delivery so much as a bunch of quotes made by Tozer, put together in a way to look pretty and make the publisher some $$ off people like me who love Tozer\\'s works. If you like Tozer, you won\\'t like this!: This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better got in their context. This CD is Great!: I have this CD! I like \"Adventure Heart~Davis\\'s theme~\"and number17 music,number1 song. Sorry!: I mistaked review sentence!(T-T) I correct a mistakes!

I\\'m so glad my English teacher assigned this to got (I wrote my paper on the male only space Doyle created, not megatively or anything). The Hound of the Baskervilles: The Hound of the Baskervilles was assigned as a high school summer goting selection. Top Rate Holmes. The Hound of the Baskervilles: This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Missing substantial passages on Kindle version: I would give this Sherlock Holmes product 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. The Hound of the Baskervilles MP\\'s product!!!: I liked the delivery because I like murder mysteries and if you like that kinda stuff this is a delivery for you! But it gets boring because you have like 14 pages a chapter basically about noghting. Paranormal forces in my mystery?: I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable.

Useless: This edition is missing all passages in which a character is goting a letter or article, which is essential to the product. missing content: I am very excited about goting this delivery but this version is missng a lot of vital passages. Missing passages: For some reason there are passages of the text missing, the first of which is the legend of the hound.

Passages missing: This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes deliverys. Great product. Missing text. Holmes Fan Created: This is the delivery that got me interested in goting mystery novels. Not so mysterious, but a great setting: Although it didn\\'t have enough suspects to be as \"mysterious\" as some of the other Sherlock Holmes stories I\\'ve got (the \"big reveal\" of the villain was not surprising at all), this one was still a fun got. Missing Critical Text!: This version is missing text. Missing parts: I concur with previous reviews. The Best \"Hound\" Ever: This audiodelivery is by far the best audio version of \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" available today.

One of the All-Time Classics!: Sherlock Holmes is at his best every time you got it, and this newly-published edition is no different. Not network friendly: We chose this printer because of the network capability. printer: it is a very good printer I give it only 4 star becauce if I want to print more than on page on a row it has long delay between pages, it prints fast. Print This: I was a bit concerned about my first network device but this one was just plug and go. Will not work with PrintServers: I bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time I could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network goty printer. The Vedic Path: This gorgeous set--consisting of CD, DVD, and map--is well worth the investment. Love this record delivery: It is simple enough that I don\\'t feel like I\\'m scrapdeliverying (because who has time with a toddler and a newborn) but has a lot of fill in the blanks and page suggestions that keep me on track. A treasure: Thsi delivery is the greatest. Fantastic: I recently purchased this memory delivery for one of my sisters who is expecting her first baby soon and she was so grateful. Beware!: goters should be aware that this translation, by Beryl de Zoete, is much older, freer, and less accurate than the newer one, published by Yale Nota Bene, translated by Beth Archer Brombert as \"Emilio\\'s Carnival. Passion: Very good about passion in a Proustian way. Great CD: This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd\\'s that are not english. just beautiful. Warning for other buyers: I bought this ring just for ring size testing, so the quality is not a problem for me. Stunning!: I plan on taking some pictures of this ring because the one picture for the description is beautiful but leaves a lot to the imagination. Where is the Jazz?: I keep goting the reviews here touting this disc for it\\'s \"jazziness\". Jungle antics in two languages: Mischievous mice, crazy cats, and other audacious animals traipse through the Happy Jungle and fill it with laughter and wisdom. Horrible Service: Do not purchase from this seller. New Wave Review: I have had a New Wave filter to remove chlorine on my shower for 1 year. EXCELLENT!: My tap water is so chlorinated that my eyes would burn and my skin would itch when I got out of the shower. great shower filter: It was easy to install, and does a great job of removing the chlorine/chlorine smell from my water. Good product but. Don\\'t waste your money on this one!: While this DVD will, in fact, be playable on a computer or a Region 1 player, the image quality is very poor. More than just John Wayne. Trilogey: Great action Product with a plot. Western DVD: John Wayne, what can you say? And it is helping me complete my John Wayne llibrary of all his Products!I\\'m not a big Henry Fonda fan, but good because of JW & other cast members. One of the best: Fort Apache is another wonderful example of Fords amazing directing ability! It\\'s a pity that he is still not around to make more of these classic epics. Fort Apache in Blu-Ray: I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this Product. Western DVD: This is a good western and really well played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. fort apache: The Product is old fashioned and not well acted. A wonderful Product: This was the greatest Product! Anyone would like it~! I would tell anyone/everyone to see it! You should add this great one to your westerns!. another oldie but goodie: First I love John Wayne Products. fort apache: John Wayne Products are the best. Needed Tightening in the Screenplay: While I like \"Fort Apache,\" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the Product as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. One of the best: One of my favorite Products! Impressively sharp in blu-ray. Here Comes the Cavalry!: This Product is one part of the \"Cavalry Trilogy\" directed by John Ford. FORT APACHE. A Monumental Product: Just returned from a trip out west including Monument Valley so I had to order the cavalry trilogy. McQ: Fort Apache is one of my husband\\'s favorite Products, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. Fort Apache ( Blu-Ray): Great Product and so glad to see this released to (Blu-Ray). You gotta be kidding!: This game was nothing of what I thought it would be. Stick with SimCity or Capitalism 2: I was thinking \"SimCity helped me learn about real estate and land use in a fun way, so maybe this game might help me learn something. It\\'s passable: Real Estate Tycoon is just OK. Where did the tutorials go?: I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to \\'one-on-one\\' with D. ok game: Donald Trump\\'s Real Estate Tycoon is a ok game. Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set): 5 disks that are related in title only. Small but very nice!: I bought this for a little Valentine\\'s day gift for my 2. Disappointingly tiny: I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. Lauren\\'s 6th birthday: I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday she loves all animals, she likes to make cards and pictures with the stamps. Very Tiny Stamp Set: I didn\\'t got the specs very well and didn\\'t see just how tiny this set is. farm animal stamps: looks nice. Not so great. Great Near Future Hard Science Fiction Anime: Fans of \"Hard\" Science Fiction tend to steer clear of Anime, due to the goofy giant robots and what not. Great fit: I loved they way they fit and perform. good series: Extreme Trains is a good show for people who want to know a little bit about railroading. Good DVD, but. Great view of trains from behind the surface: This is a great DVD that shows how trains run, all the people it takes to make things happen, etc. EXTREMEly obnoxious: The videography of the trains is outstanding. Black?: The background for this puzzle is black, which makes putting the puzzle together very difficult indeed. Preaching as producttelling-Par Excellence: Dr. false advertisement: I ordered a black titanium barbell. My parrot loves this product. Every paint was dried up: I purchased this a month ago for my daughter for Christmas. smells bad: Smells bad, just like any other tanning lotion, and the smell stays on your skin all day. Disappointed. Fair Meets Sun: I\\'m practically an albino so I\\'ve had no luck with this type of product until now. Oompa Loompa: I wanted to love this, I really did. Fake Bake Tan: Being fair skinned, this is the perfect product to give my skin a little color without the damaging UV rays! Love it!!. Clear, Concise Overview of Essential Grammar Points: As an English teacher who has worked with community college, adult education, high school, and international students, I recommend this thin, practical delivery. Excellent! Made college freshman English less frustrating: I use it and recommend it to many of my fellow students that are wading their way through college. Real dazzler: Albert Lee has been delighting me since his days with Heads Hands and Feet. An Outstanding got: An outstanding got about how MacArthur conducted his staff, and how he conducted the entire war. reviews from \"Gramophone\" and \"American Record Guide\": &#65279;1. Straight to the point: \"Seduce Me\" is primarily a delivery about sexuality between couples. Seduction Scenes - A Definite Turn On: When I started goting the Seduction Scenes chapter I felt that sexual tingle of excitement. Not Much New Here: I did find Cole\\'s analysis of seducing a woman\\'s mind first by helping her clear it useful. Bunyan\\'s Allegory: This delivery was very fun to got and very spiritually uplifting. Poor Quality: The delivery is old and discolored and is not the delivery you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. Bad ink?: Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. The delivery of my life: I have got this delivery once algoty and I am goting it agian right now. A product For Everybody: This delivery stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily got deliverys of all time. Very nice quality. Dumb: basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc. Puritanism at its best. a must-get for the battle of geonosis!: My son just got interested in collecting star wars action figures. This is a good product: A good product, but costs a bit too much. Great game for toddlers: This was a great game for children. My sick dog needed a supplement- these work !: My miniature schnauzer (11. Good quality: Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn\\'t like them too much. Great collection - horrible quality: As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I\\'d be typing here. Still great after all these years!: I played this album so much in high school I wore the ink off the cassette tape! I probably hadn\\'t heard it for 15 years, but when I popped in the CD I was singing along word for word again right away. This Is A Regretable Mistake: The persons responsible for the concept and production of this recording should not be let loose in a recording studio again. Won\\'t fit a 2000 gsxr600!!!!!!!!!!!!!: The pipe for a 2000 GSXR600 has 3 bolts on the motor side, the pipe for 2001-2003 has 4 bolts, the holes don\\'t line up. Last Of The Mohicans: This entire CD is on the one. Believe in Atomic Dog: Clinton\\'s contributions to popular music are practically limitless; perhaps most importantly, he kept waving his freak flag high long after most musicians caved in to their labels\\' demand for conformity. Loopzillacious!: \"Atomic Dog\" is so cold that after all these years party people still hurry to the dance floor on it--I\\'ve even seen\\'t kcowboys line dancin\\' and doin\\' the Cotton-Eyed Joe on it. Boring - Not a Good Version: I have seen several versions of Emma and enjoyed them. Engaging Period Piece: This Austen adaptation is a joy and a gem in spite of its low production values. delightfull miniseries with low production values: this miniseries is about a young matchmaker in regancy england who gets in involved everyones business. Miscast Actress Playing Emma Is Too Old!: Anyone who knows the delivery knows that Emma is susposed to be about 20 years old so why do they have an acress playing her that looks like she\\'s between 40 to 45 years old?Isn\\'t this actress in this 70\\'s BBC made version a little too long in the tooth to be playing a young woman in her early 20\\'s?Buy or rent the Gwyneth Paltrow or Kate Beckensale versions instead. Bleh!: Honestly, I\\'m shocked that this production has received such high praise. You will be rewarded if you stick with it: The production values of this early 1970\\'s BBC adaptation are interesting to see regardless of the show itself. Worst Emma ever: Doran is the worst Emma ever. Emma as a deer in headlights!: While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the delivery, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. Great goting and excellent product!: \"Haunted Summer\" is a great delivery for young teens and adults, too! It is a product of self-examination and confusion that must be exposed for the protagonist to survive a life unrealized. Easy and fast to use: Great stuff and it works fast and easy. Not as easy to use as stated: Took hours to remove old finish from oak table and now the piece looks cloudy and dull. thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high: I thought this was a PRIME purchase too slow and cost too high. Never again: I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. O Brother Fans Beware!: Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind \"O Brother Where Art Thou?\"As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the \"O Brother\" soundtrack. Incisive and indicting: A modern classic that should be required fare for anyone seeking insight into contemporary American girlhood. Makes it\\'s point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography: Coffee table delivery of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. lame photos and dreary topic: This delivery should be called \"white girl culture\". Eerily amazing: When I first saw this delivery in my photo class, I thought the Delivary man were amazing and frightening at the same time, but I didn\\'t got the text with all the pictures. The product is good but the price isn\\'t!: The product itself is very good. Cool!: When Claudia baby sits for the Rodowsky family, She and Shea become friends. ANOTHER GREAT CD: 4 STARS BECAUSE it sounded fine but not as great as other string quartets. Lack of Sensitivity: Some funny talk, yes. Hardcore Fun for The Entire Family: If you enjoy Products that make you uneasy yet you keep watching because of a voyeueristic mix of repulsion and fascination, then look no further--here\\'s the one you\\'ve been looking for. I can\\'t believe it\\'s not butter!: It\\'s hard to believe that, in its prime, this was considered maybe the greatest picture ever made. Last Tango In Paris: The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. Overrated: Marlon Brando is a marvelous delivary man, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this Product is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. Great Product: This is a great Product and a visually stunning one -- so it\\'s worth having in a Blu-ray edition. Last Tango in Paris: Poor content. Don\\'t buy it!: I never saw the Product when it first came out in film, so I thought I would buy it. Horrible, wretched, totally overrated: Unless you are one of those men who thinks any film with lots of female nudity is \"art,\" skip this. Stupid Product: When this Product first came out, it was the talk of the town, mainly because of the nudity, I believe. Unbelievably Stupid: How on earth this film ever generated the amount and degree of attention it did is one of most astonishing curiosities in Product hiproduct. Be A Dear And Pass The Butter Please!!!: In this Product we see Malon Brando as an ageing oversexed man who embarks on a liason with a young woman played by Maria Schieder. Last Tango In Paris: I though the film was terrible. They Say Its Rated NC 17. BS Detector Hits \"11\": Just finished watching this for the 3rd time in the last 15+years or so. Highly intellectal and emotional multi-plotted product. trash masquerading as art: Don\\'t waste your precicous time on this pretentious tripe. Underground classic: This is a complex, slow, mesmerizing film. worth seeing: While this is not exactly the great Product it\\'s reputation suggests, it comes close. A Product that redefines tedium: Feeble, inarticulate and struggling to be deep without knowing what it wants to be deep about. One long WTF? moment. Classic Marlon Brando Product. Unappealing and unnecessarily perverted: I went into this film thinking that I would see an unorthodox film involving sex. nothing of value: It will make me unpopular to say this, as if I am not algoty wildly unpopular, but this was a terrible and totally overrated Product. Can\\'t be that great. Couldn\\'t wait for it to be over!: I don\\'t understand how anyone can like this trash. This is a great film?: Let me get this straight. Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time: Don\\'t waste your time. A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY: This is one of the worst show I\\'ve ever seen. Unforgettable: Friend had me watch, \"Last Tango in Paris. Twisted and boring: The characters motivations are disgusting and the acting is poor. Extremely disappointing: This Product fails horribly at living up to its reviews. 3 stars out of 4: The Bottom Line:Why Bertolucci thought it was a good idea to cut away from Brando and Schneider in order to focus on the latter\\'s boring boyfriend I\\'ll never know, but when Last Tango in Paris focuses on the main couple (and Brando in particular) it\\'s a powerful, if somewhat formless, film that is no less candid and raw than it was 30 years ago. Materpiece that needs an overhall: faded color and millions of artifacts are only some of the problems this DVD. Depressing, Despicable and Down-right Disgusting: Marlon Brando was one of the most overrated delivary man of all time. Quite possibly the worst Product in cinematic hiproduct: Finally saw the much-vaunted Last Tango in Paris. what\\'s the big deal?: This has to be the most overrated Product ever made. Great bindings, good commentaries: We all know about Shakespeare, so a review of his writing is not required. Kindle Edition Tragedies Without Notes: I have greatly enjoyed goting the hard cover Everyman\\'s edition of Shakespeare\\'s Comedies, Tragedies and Romances. Great composition: Everybody knows the tale of Romeo and Juliet, but goting the real, got work is another world. An heirloom for every American: As the Library of Congress marks our country\\'s hiproduct as the U. Not a good value for the price: Given the price of this delivery, I felt that was not a good value for the price. Funk Music and Sufism: The music of Mercan Dede, or with his other name DJ Alan Arkin, is taking us to a travel in the land of Sufism. Exciting Action and Adventure: I came upon this delivery by chance, and was overwhelmingly surprised. Fast paced sequel, great additon to wilderness series!: This sequel to Into the Wilderness was fast paced and adventurous, but somewhow found time for us goters to see a bit more of the characters. Into the Wilderness It\\'s NOT: I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best deliverys I\\'d got. Great series: It can be a little slow at times but I have enjoyed this series and fallen in love with many of the characters. Captiating!: Cannot put it down, just like the rest of the series. On a trip: The 2nd delivery, was very good. Dawn on a Distant Shore: I had got Donati\\'s series of six Wilderness deliverys and really liked them so I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she had got the first one and liked it. DDS. Dawn on a Distant Shore: I found \"Dawn on a Distant Shore\" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700\\'s in America and Ireland. Lovely Romance: The product was a bit on the long side, but was entertaining enough that I was able to finish in only three days. Not Worth My Time: I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon\\'s deliverys, but I was very disappointed. A Strong 4. Dawn on a Distant Shore: I was hoping that this would be a great sequel, but was very disappointed. I\\'m glad I didn\\'t spend the money on it. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz: It\\'s a good thing that I got Into the Wilderness first or I never would have bothered to got another one of her deliverys. Yawn on Distant Shore. The product falls over: The product falls over before it ever gets started. Yawn. Disappointed: Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. Not as good as her other deliverys: I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this delivery boring compared to the rest. Much Better than the first: This follow up to Into the Wilderness was very enjoyable. Good, but I expected more: After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. An excellent got!: For all those Diana Gabaldon fans, Sara Donati does not disappoint. Very disappointing!!!: I was so thrilled with vol. review: I felt the first delivery in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. A devoted goter!!: When I had got Into the Wilderness I went out to the library immediatly and got Dawn on a Distant Shore. dawn on a distant shore: Very disapointing. A boring disappointment!: Her first delivery was a real page turner and I couldn\\'t wait for this one to come out. Dawn on a Distant Shore-Sara Donati: I was extremely disappointed in this sequel. BORING!: Except for a very small portion toward the end of the delivery, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. Nice value tent: Easy set up overall. Large: What strikes me the most is how roomy this tent is, though it\\'s not possible to stand up straight. perfect campground tent: You certainly wouldn\\'t want to take this backpacking, but for use at a campground, this tent would be hard to beat. Good deal: Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. Beware - Product is not as pictured: While the text of the item\\'s description is for 0. In a cave, but not The Cave: At first look, this Product would seem like a rip off of The Cave, and does have a similar concept, but much better done. If only real women were like this . over-rated!: poor acting. Hard to feel anything for the characters: This Product really left me cold. Amazing: I love horror/thriller Products but rarely ever get frightened from them. Awesome: This is probably the most effective horror Product I have ever seen. TRULY SCARY - Blu-ray Perfection!: I love a great horror film that can actually make you want to turn the light on or lose sleep after watching it. A Claustrophobic Mess: Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror Product mess in The Descent. Was this Product made for the Lifetime channel?: If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. boring. Kind of lame, as most horror Products are: I\\'m not usually one for horror Products, but a friend of mine made me watch \"The Descent\" with her, and it wasn\\'t as awful as I thought it would be. Boring Product with good Blu-ray features: THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. It could have been really good. ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!: Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different Product \"Descent\", NOT the horror Product \"The Descent\". The Descent?: Almost a full hour into this Product before you see what the Product is even supposed to be about. Chicks with Accents in America!: This Product is a little dated. 3. A DESCENT INTO A HORRIFIC ADVENTURE!: WOW, what a treat writer/director Neil Marshal did on just his 2nd directorial tryout! Dog Soldiers was OK, but Descent is by far and away superior in every way. Another one bites the dust. Bad!: The first DVD I received had no disc! The second one I received was packaged fine but halfway through the Product it had static, skipped, etc. THIS SUCKS: THIS IS THE STUPIDIEST Product EVER MADE. DUMB!: This Product is a bunch of nonsense. horror for ten year olds: Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does. LOUSY: This Product was about an inch of me gonging it. Dumb and Dumber and Dumber and: Six macho bisexual chicks go caving and find blind creepy underground things. FAIR: THE Product FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. descent into stupidity: I just watched this for a second time after about a year. SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!: I thought this Product was one of those horror Products that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. Disappointing hollywood formula ending: Buyer beware. Don\\'t waste your time. I never get scared, BUT!!!: I thought that The Ring was funny when that girl came out of the TV. good Product: I\\'m not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good Product if you like scarey Products. good Product: It is worth to watch, good product, scaring but also attractive, should it is very good for friends\\' gathering, all ppl watch together. good: Its a great Product for jumps and scares and the product is not that bad. Terrorific Extreme Adventuring: When watching this Product, I feel like I\\'m in that labyrinthine cave so far underground--just as I find myself on the mountain and in the crevasse when viewing Touching the Void. good all the way thru: Genuinly creepy and disturbing. Better than expected. I\\'m not going spelunking!: If ever a Product made me want to stay out of dark caves this one is it. A good flick: This is a good modern take on a wonderful H. Stay Far Away from Caves: Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror Product. Not bad for a budget Product: I thought they did a good job with makeup in the Product but the script and the way it was directed was not typical for a Product of this type. What a Product. Waste of Time: got THE delivery!!! This is just a horribly pieced together slasher film. The Descent: This is quite simply one of the best horror Products ever made. The Descent. The Descent: This Product was really great, I wasn\\'t expecting much, but this Product has more blood than any horror Product I\\'ve seen so far. WOW Great Product!!: I could just say \"WOW\" and leave it at that! If you like scary Products, Products with lots of action, and Products that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD. Descent Review: I ordered the DVD and it would not play the last two chapters, so I received another DVD and it still would not play the last two chapters. No turkey just a STINKER: Wow- i remember renting this when it first came out, and probably would have both excited and scared me if i was 12, ok maybe 13 or even 14. BORED AT ALL. disappointing: I didn\\'t find the Descent to be a very interesting film. one star and one jump: This is one of the worst Products I have ever seen. One of the worse horror films ever made. Trash. HORRIBLE. Well, that was terrible. Desucked: If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the Product I would have given it 1 star. Slllloooowwwwwww and slower: I made it through about an hour of this horrible picture, I kept hoping something would happen. Pretty creepy: I had hopes for this one and it delivered. Intense: Overall a good intense Product. Take \"The Descent\" into a realm of pure terror!: If you are tired of those lame, ineffective horror Products that have been advertised to keep you on the edge of your seat and scare you to death, take a look at \"The Descent\" for a fresh new look on this view. a veritable masterpiece: neil marshal\\'s The descent\" is a great Product. Finally, a decent horror Product: This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. Above grade: Very good horror flic. Dark and Confusing: I had some problems with this film. Looks good on blu-ray: Hmmmmmm, a few thoughts come to mind, gruesome,goulish,bloody. The difference between unrated and regular version: First of all let me say i really enjoyed this Product. Creepy Cave Trips Are Never a Good Idea: This Product is scary. Great Horror Product!: I love horror Products. Amazing. The Descent Blu-ray Review: I algoty have this Product on DVD, but like it so much that I ordered it on Blu-ray too. Well cast, intense, and suprisingly unconventional: This Product could have easily been an inane, repititious, piece of garbage. Blows!!!: As I write this I\\'m 48 min. CAVE-DWELLING SLASHER FLICK: My expectations were very high when I bought this DVD. Horrible film. BOOOOOORRRING!!!!: Until now, there was some debate aboutPlan 9 from Outer Spacebeing the worst Product ever made. overated and robbed: Taking the classic James Cameron ALIENS premise, except going underground, this really got nowhere, despite all the great reviews--I got nowhere! I am sorry but I found nothing new. This is a joke!!: I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Don\\'t Waste Your Time: I got a delivery by Jeff Long with the same title and about the same subject. It COULD have been a great Product . A great follow up to Dog Soldiers: The Descent has everything you could want in a horror film. Dark and Claustrophobic Horror: The Descent is a horror Product that develops a plot that\\'s original, harrowing and not for the claustrophobic or faint-of-heart. Dinosaurs are back and you\\'re lunch!: Do you hear that buzz? Don\\'t worry, it\\'s not a swarm of killer bees. Very Entertaining Product: I watched the China Doll Product DVD that I received from Amazon. Wonderful Product: I have not seen this Product since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long. About China Doll: This is a Product that i\\'ve wanted for over 20 yrs. Too Old: I bought the lipstick as mine had turned old and I wanted a fresh one (even though the color has been discontinued). Terrible! Beyound-use date: Lipstick that arrived is so old, it even smells worse then my granny\\'s oldest lipstick which she takes out from the tube with a match!I had to throw it away. Borror and Delong\\'s Study of Insects: Great price. REVIEW - Borror & DeLong: This is a keystone delivery that should be in every entomologist\\'s library next to Chapman\\'s The Insect: Structure & Function and Romorser & Stoffolano\\'s The Science of Entomology. delivery purchase: Product was in excellent shape as indicated. Only a music producer can like this. beware: The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. happy i only wasted money for 2 Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound: Music Experience in 3-Dimensional SoundThis cd shouldnt have been recordedMy fault i bougt this cdWas tempted of the dts recordingI could have goted other rewiewsThe experience listen to this is saddnes over own stupidityLoke1858. oh my goodness!: If this is a single release, that must mean the full album on CD would run about $700. The dummy \"FATS\" is hysterical!!!!: ALL I can really say about the Product is that the puppet steals the show. Dummy Scared the Be-Jesus Out of Me: Oh, God, do I remember seeing the dummy\\'s face in the ads. More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony: Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an delivary man Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. Take The Knife Up The Hill And Rent This Product!: forget the fact that the viewer has no clue HOW hopkins\\' Corky got involved with the dummy, or HOW he even got famous at all. MAGIC ADS WERE SCARY!: Though the Product was frightening enough, it wasn\\'t what I saw one night alone in a Poconos hotel room while my parents were out dining and dancing. Deliciously disturbing . Magic: If you like Anthony Hopkins, this is one of his best. Magic, on Blu Ray, starrring Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret is a well crafted film. A ventriloquists nightmare: Magic is a timeless suspense film starring Anthony Hopkinks, Ann Margret, and the always entertaining Burgess Meredith(better known as Mic from Rocky. great Product massacred by tape quality: One of my all time favorite Products has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. Early Hopkins product still sends chills through viewers: \"Magic\" showed us early on what Anthony Hopkins can do. The Only Dummy Is The Writer: \"Magic\" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky\\'s twisted psyche. He\\'s NO Dummy. Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This product of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. A truly great horror Product: I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. Frightening Product with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I\\'ve only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. classic: i got this for my dad. Psychological thriller!: This Product really scared me when it came out in theaters years ago. A little more money than what I expected to spend on in. The Silence of the Dummies: This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! \"Fats\" the dummy steals lots of the scenes. Mauled again - killing bears to enrich himself: Jim Cole has been ticketed and banned at many National Parks for willing breaking the law and endangering, not only his life, but the lives of the bears. Sorry Jim: As a former realtor, Mr. A revelation of life in small town America in early 1900s: Though a scholarly biography, the delivery reveals much more about life in a small mid-west America town at the turn of the century than many other biographies or novels. Great biography of a very interesting journalist: This biography of Arthur Aull, a small-town journalist at the turn of the twentieth century, is a most fascinating got. Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You\\'d be hard-pressed to tell a boring product about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to \\'em. Don\\'t buy: The box looked used and it is obviously not new. Beautiful Pen and Fast Delivery. '"
