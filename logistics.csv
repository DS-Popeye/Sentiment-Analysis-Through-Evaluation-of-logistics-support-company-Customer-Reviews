Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid  game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras  It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^,Positive
"The best soundtrack ever to anything : I'm goting a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit  This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece  The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny ",Positive
"Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down  The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years  The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it I wish I could give it 6 stars ",Positive
"Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music  I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful On disk one  my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three  Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music Xander Cross",Positive
"Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a product of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel  (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be  Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper ",Positive
"an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to got this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here  And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget  It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers) This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever  ^_^",Positive
"Buyer beware: This is a self-published delivery, and if you want to know why--got a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been got by Ms  Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone goting the whole thing--I spent an evening with the delivery and a friend and we were in hysterics goting bits and pieces of it to one another  It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst delivery"" contest  I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing  Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a delivery I am quite sure Ms  Haddon never heard of  Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a delivery to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!",Negative
"Glorious product: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints  The product was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the delivery  I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this delivery and so I bought it  I loved it !! This is a brilliant product because it is so true  This delivery was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to got it  It is not a typical romance, it is so much more  Not goting this delivery is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming product ",Positive
"A FIVE STAR delivery: I just finished goting Whisper of the Wicked saints  I fell in love with the caracters  I expected an average romance got, but instead I found one of my favorite deliverys of all time  Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant goter  If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must got  Don't let the cover fool you this delivery is spectacular!",Positive
"Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to got delivery that made me want to keep goting on and on, not easy to put down It left me wanting to got the follow on, which I hope is coming soon  I used to got a lot but have gotten away from it  This delivery made me want to got again  Very enjoyable ",Positive
"The Worst!: A complete waste of time  Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing  I'm embarrassed for this  Company and very disappointed I actually paid for this delivery ",Negative
"Great delivery: This was a great delivery,I just could not put it down,and could not got it fast enough  Boy what a delivery the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next  This delivery makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery  this delivery can make you go throu several of your emotions  This is a quick got romance  It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you got at night ",Positive
"Great got: I thought this delivery was brilliant, but yet realistic  It showed me that to error is human  I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him  I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down  I also loved The glass castle ",Positive
"Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one  All others beware! It is absolute drivel  I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the delivery removed all doubt  Wait - maybe I'm missing the point  A quick re-got of the beginning now makes it clear  This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes  Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10 95 after all ",Negative
"Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money  This delivery seems to have been got by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter  For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house  I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to got with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling  Please don't waste your money  I too, believe that the good reviews must have been got by the  Company's relatives  I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!",Negative
"Don't try to fool us with fake reviews : It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been got by the same person, perhaps the  Company herself  They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the delivery  Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an  Company?",Negative
"A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA""  This is a very cool product about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner  As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players  With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!",Positive
"Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings  I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings  Then I found Jobst UltraSheer  They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose  Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice **Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh  I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day  I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling ",Positive
"Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product  However, they are very difficult to get on for older people  I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on  Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin  I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help ",Positive
sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart  I tried to put it and sheer it!  I guess you should not buy this item in the internet  it is better to go to the store and check it,Negative
"mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622  Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need  Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time  Good riddance/bad investment!",Negative
"Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix  I got the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies  But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix  If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise  Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky)  However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy)  Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix ",Positive
"Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution  Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white  The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded  Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE  Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel Just none of them appear to be on Amazon ",Negative
"A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters  I don't know of any other delivery that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture  True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully got delivery of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family  Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young  Company, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out  A great got!",Positive
"i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days ",Positive
"Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years  It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries  To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end  In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold  The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up  What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around  You know how painful that is ",Negative
"Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers  the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges   true  The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done  Which is also true  24 hours of charging and the lights stay on  I returned it thinking I had a bad unit The new one did the same thing  I just kept it since it does charge   but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on  It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger ",Negative
"Disappointed: I got the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed  The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time  I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries ",Negative
"Oh dear: I was excited to find a delivery ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating  It doesn't begin to explain how or why Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal "" Gee whiz, what a disappointment I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid  But there is not a single one in the delivery I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation --Alyssa A  Lappen",Negative
"Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS Products quite yet  Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice  I agree with the easy set-up  It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual  And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)   but those are my only complaints  This is a good product for your $$$ ",Positive
"Incorrect disc!: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store  I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy  The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work  All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message ",Negative
"happy with it   but: I'm a JVC nut   I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one deliveryshelf audio system and car audio system  So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be  I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer  I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono   wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it  VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!",Positive
"Is this great TV??? You bet it is: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV   it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated Product ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey)  The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show  The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it  I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great  The season finale was an interesting to watch The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988  The reason   Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC ",Positive
"Nothing you don't algoty know: If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have algoty got everything there is in this delivery, do not waste your money, seriously!!",Negative
"Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit : When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD  However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class  The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party  I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach  Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers  Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B Product  The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha  Surfers don't CHA ",Negative
"Rochelle explains It All for You: Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This delivery is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities  The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1  This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings  A great delivery",Positive
"More great playing: Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing  Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control  Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'  A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again ",Positive
"Doesn't work on a Mac: It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system  The disk comes and it does not, only Windows   Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!",Negative
"Very Frustrating: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since  You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the ""power-up segments"" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun  Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it ",Negative
"Many a times payment gateways are an issue, so getting the refund and the surcharges are an inconvenience",Negative
Language barrier is also one major issue  Moslty these delivery boys are only familiar with Kanada which creates a problem while addressing any issue ,Negative

A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had got the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since!
